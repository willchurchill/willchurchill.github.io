        <h1 id="lets-start-with-shared-hosting-what-is-it">Let’s start with Shared Hosting… what is it?</h1>

<p>Think of renting a flat in an apartment complex. You get in the building, and have access to your front door. You can invite in whoever you like, put in whatever furniture you want, and in this case the landlord super generous, so you can even paint the walls whatever colour suits you. Shared Hosting is a little like this. What you are getting is space on a company’s server to host your website. Within that space, you can do more or less as you please.</p>

<p>It’s a great solution for a lot of websites, at a comparatively low cost (the flat analogy can only take us so far).</p>

<p>But there are some limitations. As a tenant of a shared hosting provider, you don’t have access to the underlying configuration of the server. Often, that isn’t a deal breaker. In fact, if you’re not sure why you would need access to the underlying configuration, then you probably don’t need it - most people don’t. Some sites however need a little more, and Shared Hosting can limit your use of some of the more flashy and modern programming languages.</p>

<p>Perhaps more commonly felt is the limitation of shared resources. Back to our flat analogy, and imagine your neighbour is throwing a big house party with lights and smoke machines, and a great sound system, and they accidentally trip the power to the whole building. Or maybe it’s as simple as all of their guests take up all the parking outside the building and your guests can’t get in. In a similar way, if another tenant on your shared hosting has a massive traffic spike, or does something to take up more than expected resources, there is a chance that your website might temporarily suffer.</p>

<h1 id="well-that-sounds-fair-enough-but-are-there-security-implications-to-shared-vs-the-others">Well that sounds fair enough, but are there security implications to shared vs the others?</h1>

<p>The short answer is “yes”. Thinking back to our flat analogy, if someone breaks into your neighbour’s flat, they may well find it easier to get into yours. In most cases, there is nothing “physically” separating your website from another tenants. 90% of the time this may not matter, but if someone can break into the main building, then your front door might be less of a challenge.</p>

<p>In reality, this is a slight oversimplification. For one thing, just as you have a lock on the front door of both the apartment block, and your own flat, so too can you have security on both the server and your individual website. In fact, most shared hosting providers now make a point of explaining the firewalls and DDoS protection that they put in place at a tenant level as well as on their servers as a whole. Even if they don’t advertise this, there are ways of securing your individual website - just as you might put a deadbolt on your front door.</p>

<h1 id="ok-but-what-are-my-other-options">Ok, but what are my other options?</h1>

<p>Traditionally, your options were Shared Hosting, or something called a Virtual Private Server - or VPS. Slightly more recently, a third option - Cloud Hosting - has sprung up. There are differences between VPS and Cloud Hosting, but for most of the rest of this article, I’m going to lump them together. My reasoning for this is that, for the average user, the pros and cons of VPS and Cloud when compared to Shared Hosting are the same. If you do want to go down either of these routes though, <a href="mailto:will@willrc.co.uk">do get in touch</a> to see if there’s more you might want to discuss.</p>

<p>The main difference with VPS/Cloud is that, rather than taking up a portion of a server that’s shared with other tenants, you get your very own set of resources. One major benefit of this is that you don’t have to worry about next door’s house party - because there isn’t a next door.</p>

<p>Another benefit is that Cloud Hosting in particular is great for sites that have spikes of traffic - for example if you’re running a seasonal e-commerce business, you may need more resource at certain times of the year. Cloud plans can enable you to pay for only what you use on any given month, scaling up or down as needed.</p>

<p>Cloud and VPS also (in most cases) give you much more control over the underlying server than Shared Hosting. In practice, this means there isn’t a limit to the kind of website you can create. If you want to develop your own web app for something, Shared Hosting is not likely to be the right call for you. Cloud and VPS on the other hand will give you that flexibility.</p>

<p>Finally, another benefit of Cloud Hosting specifically, is that in the event of a hardware failure of the hosting provider itself, your site is transferred over to another instance immediately, meaning that Cloud Hosting offers much better uptime/downtime statistics than other hosting options.</p>

<h1 id="great---these-sound-way-better-why-dont-we-all-do-this">Great - these sound way better. Why don’t we all do this?</h1>

<p>Well there are a few reasons. The first, and most immediately obvious, is cost. VPS and Cloud are almost always more expensive than the equivalent package as a shared hosting option. Sometimes by orders of magnitude.</p>

<p>The other thing to consider is that - particularly for VPS - you’re responsible for all the updating, security patching, and general upkeep of the server. This is more than just ensuring your WordPress is up to date - this is making sure the underlying system is functioning as it needs to. In most cases, there is a relatively high level of technical understanding needed to do this.</p>

<p>One other thing to consider, is that all of the performance benefits are only really going to be seen if you are bringing in significant amounts of traffic. For most smaller organisations, individual blog sites, or sites without a huge amount of interactive features, hosting it on a shared plan or on a VPS isn’t likely to be the thing that makes the difference in page speed.</p>

<p>In short, for a lot of websites - and particular those of smaller organisations - VPS or Cloud is just overkill. The on-paper benefits you gain are not likely to be realised, whereas the cost and technical debt accrued will be.</p>

<h1 id="are-these-my-only-options">Are these my only options?</h1>

<p>Absolutely not! There are almost as many hosting options out there as there are types of website. I work with a lot of clients using WordPress as their platform of choice. <strong>Managed WordPress Hosting</strong>, typically a type of Shared Hosting, is another option I invite some to consider.</p>

<p>Typically more expensive than shared hosting, it offers two main benefits. One is that it circumvents some of the drawbacks of generic shared hosting, by optimising performance for WordPress (where ‘regular’ shared hosting has to account for a wider range of needs). It also takes care of the core and plugin updates for you, and most offer automated backup and restore solutions either as part of the plan or for a small extra fee.</p>

<h1 id="so-what-should-i-do">So, what should I do?</h1>

<p>If you’re a small organisation, an individual running a portfolio site, and/or your website is mostly just for information (perhaps with a small online shop), then Shared Hosting is probably the way to go. It’s relatively cheap, requires less technical knowledge to maintain, and the drawbacks can be addressed in other ways (such as increasing security on a WordPress site by added a firewall plugin).</p>

<p>If on the other hand, you’re looking to scale quickly, use the very latest in web technology, and/or are looking to run a robust e-commerce platform, you may want to consider Cloud Hosting, or even a VPS.</p>
