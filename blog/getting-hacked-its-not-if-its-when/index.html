        <p>I spend much of my professional time reminding people of the importance of good cyber security. This week, that lesson hit home for me, as my LinkedIn profile was hacked. For about 48 hours someone else had complete control over my account.</p>

<p>And they really did a number on me. For starters, they changed my password and changed the two-step verification to make sure I couldn’t get back in. They also changed my name and profile picture, replaced all my education and work experience, and deleted all my recent activity to replace it with their own.</p>

  <figcaption class="post-image-caption">I had a fun couple of days going back and forth with LinkedIn... Thanks "Lesley".</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It could have been worse. I eventually got it back (by filling out <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1340402">LinkedIn’s Report Unauthorized Access form</a>). In any case, there are limited (though not zero) things you can do with access to my LinkedIn account. The whole experience did serve as a reminder that, even if you’re constantly preaching the good cyber security word, no one is immune from being compromised.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s not a case of “if” you get hacked, but “when”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m still looking in to how it happened, but it could have been a number of different things. My current working theory is that I fell foul of any one of a number of recent <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/news/story/nearly-10-billion-passwords-leaked-6091644/">password leaks</a>. Or maybe it isn’t as complicated as that. LinkedIn is not exactly known for being Fort Knox. <a href="https://nazmul-ahsan.medium.com/your-linkedin-account-can-get-hacked-by-anyone-and-there-is-nothing-you-can-do-about-it-2fbf17a6ddd4">This blog post</a> from LinkedIn user Nazmul Ahsan, describes how all it took to lose his account was for someone to contact customer service and pretend to be him.</p>

<p>But why would anyone bother? I’m not particularly active on LinkedIn, and there isn’t much data held privately that you can’t see on my public profile. What benefit does someone get by stealing my account?</p>

<p>Well, in 2024 it’s getting increasingly harder to scam people. As viewers of Netflix’s Sweet Bobby will know, one of the things that makes a lie believable is accompanying evidence. Creating a series of fake social media accounts is easy. Creating <em>believable</em> social media accounts, with hundreds of connections to other people? Well, that’s a little more complicated. It’s far easier to just steal an existing account, wipe the recent history, and replace it with your own content. I suspect that, if I’d let the perpetrator carry on, they would have used it as a base from which to scam other people.</p>

  <p>Everyone is <strong>a</strong> target, even if you’re not <strong>the</strong> target.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-you-protect-yourself-against-hackers">How can you protect yourself against hackers?</h2>

<p>I’ve already said that being hacked is inevitable, and I stand by that. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t still put up a good fight. What can you do to make it as hard as possible for people to get access to your data?</p>

<h3 id="good-password-hygiene-is-crucial">Good password hygiene is crucial.</h3>

<p>This section should be teaching you to suck eggs. But I would be remiss as a technology professional if I didn’t put it here, so let’s just dive in.</p>

<h4 id="make-your-passwords-long-and-complicated"><strong>Make your passwords long and complicated.</strong></h4>

<p>A simple piece of advice for a simple reason. Regardless of whether a human or a machine is trying to guess your password, the longer and more complicated it is, the harder it will be to guess. Adding symbols, numbers, and a mixture of upper and lower case letters all add to the complexity.</p>

<p>Hard to guess doesn’t have to be hard to remember. BeCyberSafe.com have an excellent article for <a href="https://www.becybersafe.com/passwords/password-ideas.html">12 Strong Password Ideas</a>, one of which is using a sentence as your password. For example, rather than putting your cat’s name followed by “1234”, you might have a password like “MittensReallyLikesHer3SquareMealsADay!”. It includes the usually compulsory mixture of cases, numbers, and special characters, while also being long and hard to guess.</p>

<h4 id="dont-use-the-same-password-for-multiple-accounts"><strong>Don’t use the same password for multiple accounts.</strong></h4>

<p>If I used the same password for LinkedIn as, say, for my email account, then anyone gaining access to one also gets the other. If you control my email account, you have a much stronger chance of being able to gain access to pretty much any online service I have - including the big scary ones like online banking, government portals, etc.</p>

<p>By making sure that every single account I have uses a different password, I limit my exposure if one of those accounts is compromised.</p>

<h4 id="change-your-password-frequently"><strong>Change your password frequently.</strong></h4>

<p>This advice is not as universal as the others. In fact, even the National Cyber Security Centre recommends <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/problems-forcing-regular-password-expiry">not forcing users to frequently change passwords</a>. There is good reason for that. If you’re asking people to change their passwords every 3 months, eventually they are going to get bored of thinking up new complex passwords. Instead, they’ll settle for the old “stick an exclamation mark at the end of the last password” method. This is a slippery slope to weaker and weaker passwords, until you’re all but forced by your brain to just use the same simple password for everything, because you can’t think of your 43rd new password of the year for yet another platform.</p>

<p>On the flipside, if your data gets leaked, by changing your passwords frequently you limit the amount of time between your password being available and it being useful. Legally, organisations who know of a data leak should report this to users as soon as possible. So you could just keep an eye out… on every communication channel… for every online service you use… assuming that every platform knows the second they are breached… and are definitely not slow to let everyone know about it…</p>

<p>All I’m saying is that while I agree with the NCSC that forcing people to change their passwords frequently can lead to lazy passwords, it can give an extra layer of protection. <strong><em>But only if your passwords are good.</em></strong> And to make sure you hit all of these criteria, we move onto the next tool in your arsenal…</p>

<h3 id="if-all-this-sounds-like-a-lot-have-you-considered-a-password-manager">If all this sounds like a lot, have you considered a password manager?</h3>

<p>I literally can’t count the number of online services I use. The idea that I could come up with a complex, unique password for each of those, and change it even once a year (let alone every 3 months), is madness. So I don’t bother with any of that.</p>

<p>Instead, I use a password manager. There are loads of options: LastPass, Bitwarden, 1Password, Proton Pass, to name just 4 off the top of my head. Each has their own set of pros and cons, their own price points, and their own loyal user bases. Which one is right for you will depend, but look out for some basic protections like strong encryption, secure password generators, and helpful bonuses like dark web scanning.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>“But Will? What if the Password Manager gets hacked?”</strong> I hear you ask. What a fantastic question. And it does happen. A couple of years ago LastPass - a service I often recommended - <a href="https://blog.lastpass.com/posts/notice-of-recent-security-incident">suffered a major data breach</a>. This is where ensuring your password manager has strong encryption comes in. In the LastPass case, hackers gained access to a bunch of passwords, but they couldn’t read them without breaking the encryption. This is <em>technically</em> possible, but extremely hard to do.</p>

<p>But nothing is flawless, and that’s why you need one more string to your cyber security bow…</p>

<h3 id="dont-just-rely-on-your-password">Don’t just rely on your password.</h3>

<p>Use Multifactor Authentication wherever possible. Sometimes called 2-Factor Authentication, or Two Step Verification, this is exactly what it sounds like. Your password is not the only thing the platform will ask you for to ensure you are the owner of the account.</p>

<p>Most major platforms will allow you to do this now, and some (including most banks) in fact demand it. It is annoying, I know. It’s annoying to setup. And it’s annoying having to dig out your phone every time you want to check your Bluesky feed on your laptop. But take it from me, having to spend the day undoing a bunch of changes to your compromised LinkedIn account - including adding back in nearly 20 years of deleted work experience - is considerably more annoying.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts…</h2>

<p>You might be thinking that, as a technology consultant (and general IT-know-it-all), I would be pretty embarrassed that I lost control of my LinkedIn account for two days.</p>

<p>But the truth is I’m not.</p>

<p>Everyone, at some point in their online journey, is going to experience a cyber security mishap. Maybe it will be a dodgy email you don’t quite read properly, a link you don’t double check. Perhaps, you really needed to send a work email and the only option was public WiFi. Or, maybe you did everything right, and an online service suffers a data breach.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason, if it hasn’t happened to you yet, it will. Don’t panic, and don’t be ashamed. Just don’t make it too easy.</p>
