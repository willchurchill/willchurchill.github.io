        <p>I popped into my local library the other day. I needed to print a delivery label for something, and I’d long since given up on owning a printer. I mean, why have a huge chunk of plastic taking up space, for the two times a year you need to print something, when it constantly thinks it’s out of ink, or needs its drivers replacing, takes and age to start up, never has the…</p>

<p>I’m digressing. Let’s start again…</p>

<p>I went to the library the other day to print something. It took me <strong><em>forever</em></strong>. Why? Was the library busy? Did the computers run slowly? Was there no one around to help with the infernally slow system?</p>

<p>Nope. None of that happened.</p>

<p>It took so long because I took so long. I couldn’t understand how the system worked. I’d have been out of there quicker if I’d asked any of the three staff around for help. But no, I am a tech expert (and also a stubborn man), so I did not ask for help. It’s just a networked printer for goodness’ sake. How hard could it be?</p>

<p>Anyway, 15 minutes later I gave in and asked for help. They couldn’t have been nicer when they showed me how absurdly easy everything was. They even pointed out that I didn’t need to use the library computer at all. If I connected my phone to the WiFi and scanned the QR code on the printer, I could print straight from my device.</p>

<p>I guess I have two points here.</p>

<p>The first is this: support your local library. They’re great. Your mileage is going to vary, but in my case, if I need to print something, I know it’ll cost me 20p and take less than 3 minutes. (Or at least, it will next time).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everyone struggles with technology. Everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My second point is this: everyone struggles with technology. Everyone. I’ve worked in tech for well over a decade. I’ve run technology transformation projects in hospitals. I’ve organised tech conferences, hackathons, and workshops across the country. I’ve been coding since I was 15 years old and have built dozens of websites from the ground up for just about every use case you could imagine. I currently manage the technology for one of the UK’s largest private foundations. And, it took me 20 minutes to print something at my local library. Everyone struggles with tech.</p>

<p>Not only does technology move so fast, but the requirements in any given case are so different. I set up the printing at my office, so in theory, I shouldn’t have had an issue. But the expectation on how that works is completely different. 40-something known people, printing from pre-approved devices, inside a private building, is a very different ask from a public building with potentially 100s of people a day needing to print from any number of devices. A pastry chef works in the kitchen, but they might not be the best person in the building to cook you a beef Wellington. (Note to self: rewatching The Bear always makes for better metaphors.)</p>

<p>To reiterate, there was nothing wrong with how the library was set up. It was intuitive, functioned quickly, and did exactly what I needed it to do. It was, with perhaps only a little hyperbole, perfect.</p>

<p>My issue was that I just wasn’t familiar with the system, and I immediately laid my assumptions of how it “should” work on top of it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not all technology is built with all people in mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m certainly not bad when it comes to tech. But I think that’s my point - I don’t believe anyone is inherently bad at technology. It’s just that a lot of tech is designed only considering a certain type of mindset. I have that mindset. But when I encounter a system that is specifically built to account for people who aren’t nerds who don’t think in that way, I need to take a step back.</p>

<p>No one is inherently bad at technology. It’s just that not all technology is built to help all people equally. We need to get better at that.</p>
