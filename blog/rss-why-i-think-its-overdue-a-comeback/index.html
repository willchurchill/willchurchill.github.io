        <h1>RSS: Why I think it's overdue a comeback</h1>

        <p>I’ve been thinking a lot about RSS lately. I know, I know. My last post was about the emerging super-tech that is generative AI. And here I am thinking about technology that predates the original iPad. By a decade. But you heard it here first: RSS is making a comeback! We’re hearing more and more about ChatGPT, Co-Pilot, Gemini, and the others. But I’ve also been hearing more and more people talk about RSS. Even the guys over on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/podcasts/hard-fork-ai-news-media-a16z-chris-dixon.html">Hard Fork podcast</a> have been chatting about it.</p>

<p>For me, the two things are related - the more we’re talking about the new and shiny AI tools, the more we’re also talking about some of the early building blocks of the web.</p>

<p>So, what is RSS? Where did it go? And why is it coming back? Well friends, grab yourself a cup of tea and settle in…</p>

<h1 id="what-is-rss-a-quick-intro">What is RSS: a quick intro</h1>

<p>RSS (“really simple syndication”) is a text-based, machine-readable, web feed. It’s essentially a way of tracking when a particular source has posted something new. In the early days of the internet, the World Wide Web was just that - a web of barely connected websites, from blogs, forums, news pages, webcomics, you name it. And if you wanted to keep up to date on everything, you needed to visit each of those places individually to find out what was happening. You “surfed the web”, if you will.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You used to have to “surf the web” because there was no easy way to bring together the things you wanted to see.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, in 1999, RSS came along. It gave us a way for websites to let users know when there was an update. Instead of going to your favourite blogger’s website every morning when you got to work and keeping your fingers crossed, you’d fire up your RSS Reader and get a list of the latest from across your web.</p>

<p>This was a game-changer. With an RSS Reader, you could amalgamate everything you wanted to check out from different pockets of the internet. If that sounds like a familiar concept to you, that’s because the way we use the web hasn’t really changed since then. The main difference is that today, instead of RSS feeds, we use social media. One social media platform above others has taken on the mantle of spiritual successor to our good friend RSS: Twitter.</p>

<h1 id="where-did-rss-go">Where did RSS go?</h1>

<p>While Twitter was never the most popular social media platform by number of users - that honour goes to Facebook - it had something none of the others had. The brevity of posts, the ability to follow anyone, and the vast mix of noraml people, celebrities, organisations, and news outlets, meant it really was the only place you needed if you wanted to curate your sources of knowledge. People who had blogs would let their Twitter followers know when they posted. News outlets would post breaking stories on Twitter. Pop stars would annouce their latest albums. If you wanted to update the wider world about something, you headed over to let that little blue bird know.</p>

<p>It had the upsides of RSS - ease of use, and all your favourite things in one place. But it also had RSS beat in one very big way. RSS is a one-way street. Twitter gave you the ability to talk back. To anybody. About anything. Communication was never the same again.</p>

<p>The late 2000s / early 2010s saw a steady decline in RSS. In 2013, Google shutdown it’s RSS Reader, signaling to many that the age of RSS had officially ended. The technology still lived on, of course. In fact, even today if you subscribe to any podcasts, it’s RSS that lets your app know when a new episode is live. And most publications and blogs still have RSS feeds built into them - apps like Feedly and Omnivore will make use of them for you. But it’s no longer part of the mainstream vernacular of the internet.</p>

<p>I think that might change.</p>

<h1 id="what-might-cause-the-renairssance">What might cause the renaiRSSance</h1>

<p>Alright, that one was a stretch…</p>

<p>For all its lack of two-way communication, or fancy hashtagging, you know one thing RSS never did? It never showed you anything you hadn’t subscribed to. As social media platforms needed to capture more users and drive more traffic, they implemented algorithms. These bits of code learned what you shared, made notes of what the people you followed liked, and ultimately started to change what you saw on your feed. Platforms included adverts and promoted posts. They showed you things that people outside your internet circle thought were popular. As time went on, less and less of your feed was things that you had originally signed up to follow.</p>

<p>For some people in some contexts, this is fine. Better than fine in fact. TikTok pretty much operates on the basis that its users want to see new, popular, trending things, regardless of who it’s from. In other corners of the internet though, this isn’t what people signed up for. Elon Musk was the final straw for Twitter, but usage was declining long before that.</p>

<p>People are still consuming content at increasing rates though. By the time NPR left X, the news outlet reported a <a href="https://niemanreports.org/articles/npr-twitter-musk/">negligible decline</a> in visitors to their site. It didn’t matter that they’d gone, because people had already been getting their NPR updates from another medium. A large part of their traffic had long been coming from - you guessed it! RS- nah I’m kidding. It was newsletters.</p>

<p>Newsletters, in fact, have been doing remarkably well. Back in 2022, Reuters reported that <a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/journalism-media-and-technology-trends-and-predictions-2022">70% of the publishers</a> they surveyed were putting more resources into newsletters than other platforms. They were betting big on email, and pulling funding from “traditional” social media. Why is that, I wonder? What is it about subscribing to a specific publication, and getting the updates from that publication all in one place, that you can peruse at your leisure?</p>

<h1 id="so-newsletters-are-the-way-forward-not-rss">So newsletters are the way forward, not RSS?</h1>

<p>Maybe. But I think newsletters are only a small part of the puzzle.</p>

<p>People want more control over the content they consume. Newsletters give that, but there are still hurdles. From the content creator side, there’s no shortage of platforms you can use to run a newsletter business. But as with many things tech, these platforms themselves come under scrutiny. Substack, perhaps the best-known platform, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/11/substack-extremism-nazi-white-supremacy-newsletters/676156/">hit the headlines late last year</a> for all the wrong reasons when it refused to take down the newsletters of actual neo-Nazis. They later backtracked (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24030756/substack-nazi-newsletter-content-moderation">sort of…</a>), but the whole affair caused a lot of discussion in the space about where content creators should go to host their content. What was wrong, some asked, with the good old-fashioned website?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We want more control over the content we consume. Social media isn’t giving us that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I also think there is a space for content consumption outside of our email inboxes. I’ve <a href="https://willrc.co.uk/articles/ive-recently-changed-how-i-consume-content/">talked before</a> about how I use Omnivore and RSS to get my news. I’m a nerd, and not representative of the population at large. However, I think there is something to be said for a completely curated feed, free of algorithmic influence, and separate from the systems we have to use for work. For about 5 minutes, I thought <a href="https://willrc.co.uk/musings/yes-im-on-mastodon-now-too/">Mastodon might be the answer</a>. But the social media landscape is now far too fragmented. Between Mastodon, and BlueSky, and Threads, and X, and the half dozen others that will have popped up in the time it’s taken me to write this post, it’s just not a streamlined way for someone producing content to reach a wide audience.</p>

<p>So, I’m setting my stall out. I think we’ll see the comeback of RSS. It’s not the solution we deserve, but it’s the one we need right now.</p>
