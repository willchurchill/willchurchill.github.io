There are a lot of todo list methodologies out there. The 1-3-5 method, the Grocery List method, Bullet Journalling. The list is endless. I swear I've even met people who have lists to keep track of all their other lists. 

Sufficed to say, the world is not short of ways to organise one's thoughts. It probably doesn't need more. So in that spirit, I thought I'd chat about one that I've just started using.

## The 4,3,2,1 todo list

I'm sure I didn't invent this myself. That said, I can't find much else out there that looks like this, or with my rationale for why it works for me. So I don't thing of this as *my* method, so much as it's one that I use. 

I like todo lists because they compartmentalise things for me. I find it useful to be able to take the thoughts out of my head, put them somewhere, and then allow myself the headspace to figure out how to tackle them. Recently though I've found myself increasingly overwhelmed with the things I have to do, wearing the various different hats I have. Sometimes putting your different hats on at different times is just not possible.

When that happens, I use the 4,3,2,1 list:

- I list out the first four things that I need to. These things are the immediate things that need to happen in order for me to calm down and get back on track. On a standard work day, these might include responding to an urgent email. On a bad mental health day, it might include getting out of bed.
- The next three things are usually a little more substantial, but still somewhat time sensitive.
- The next two things have little in the way of time sensitivity. By this point, the things that you're trying to acheive are less immediate, and should bring you benefit in the medium-term.
- The last one item has the least amount of pressure attached to it. If you're the kind of person who things in stretch goals, then this could be it.

## Why does this help?
For me, this came out of trying to manage myself when I'm having acute periods of intense anxiety. It borrows heavily from the [54321 Grounding Technique](https://insighttimer.com/blog/54321-grounding-technique/) some people use when they are anxious. I like the countdown element of it, and I like how strongly it helps focus me. It's not outcome driven in the way that most todo lists are, and certainly isn't suitable for managing projects or complex issues. Rather it focuses on getting you to do things - the aim is to get you out of the rut of anxiety and just start ticking things off the list.

That's why the first four are perhaps the most important. To be honest, most of the time I never actually get to the 2 and 1 levels, as by that time I've got back on track and one of my other 1 million productivity systems will have taken over.

## You know Will, I wouldn't be averse to trying this.

Well then dear reader do I have a treat for you. If you use Chrome as your web browser of choice, I've created [this extension]() that you can install. It's deliberately super basic, with almost no customisation options, nothing in the way of sub-tasks or tags or categorisation. It's basically just an interface to add 10 todo items, broken down into sections. Regardless, I've been using it and I like it, so I figured someone else might too. 

If you're a developer and want to have a play with the insides, you can fork the GitHub repo [from here](https://github.com/willchurchill/4321). Fair warning, I very much threw this together, and it's not my most elegant code.
