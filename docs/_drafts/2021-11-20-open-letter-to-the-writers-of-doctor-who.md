Dear RTD,

First thing first: I wouldn't presume to know how to run a writers room, or indeed write an episode of a TV show - let alone an entire series. Let alone a part of the longest running science-fiction show in history. (Well, in earth history anyway - amirite? \*wink\*)

What I am though, is a nerd.

My problem with Doctor Who of late is probably the same problem a lot of people have with a lot of franchises. I have a similar concern (if you're interested) with the likes of the MCU, for example. It's a power creep issue. As the series (or franchise) goes on, it seems the stakes have to get higher in order to keep the interests of the audience.

The thing is, Doctor Who has a built-in protection against this. Each new Doctor is - by canon (such as it is in Who, and I'll come to that) - a brand new person. They retain the memories of their previous life, but otherwise are an entirely different being. 

Even beyond that, it's possible for the Doctor to understand the reach of their actions and pull back. In fact, Matt Smith's doctor had this exact epiphany. He was able to wipe himself from the memory of the universe because he had become (in his own words) "to big for his boots".

And yet we seem to be in a situation where each story arc has to be a bigger threat to the entire universe. It's getting a bit tiring, to be honest. Of course there should be episodes with higher stakes than others, but it seems like all of them are now fights to save the very fabric of space-time. 

And of course, in order to match these every growing threats, our titular hero must also level-up each time we see them. This is narratively problematic. It's a common misconception that our eyes into the show are through the companions. That is true. But we also have to see a little of ourselves in the Doctor. They are the guide through the universe, but they aren't omnipotent. They aren't a God, or a super-genius. They are clever, by virtue of being a 1000-year old being from a technologically advanced race who's been around the galactic block a few times. But they aren't infallible.

Of course, the companions are very important. Or at least they are supposed to be. But how much did you learn about Rose, who she was and what she stood for, compared to - let's say Yas. Or worse, Bill? Poor Bill, whose only role, it seemed, was to remind the audience every three minutes that she wasn't heterosexual or middle class, so that we could be assured that the BBC was taking diversity very seriously.

The delight of the show is in its ability to marry historically semi-accurate but fun episodes, like [the one with Shakespeare in it] with the more sci-fi flavours of the show [like the one with New New New New New... New York]. Then, every once in a while, you'll get an episode like The Girl in the Fireplace which manages to do both.

Neither, while we're on the subject, should they have deus-ex-machinas at every turn. For me, nothing exemplifies this better than the evolution of the sonic screwdriver. This is a device that, for all intents and purposes, should just be a really good screwdriver. It opens things. I understand the requirement for it to also scan, and I'm onboard with that. But having it as a point-and-click miracle worker seems convinent to the point of pointlessness.

As for who the next Doctor should be, I genuinely couldn't care less. It's not about them. They are the vehicle for the audience to experience the Who-niverse.

Most sincerely,
