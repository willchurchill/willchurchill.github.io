## Galloway split the vote on the left

He may well have done. But let's have a look at the maths.

- Labour (Leadbeater): 13,296 (35.3%)
- Conservative (Stephenson): 12,973 (34.4%)
- Workers Party (Galloway): 8,264 (21.9%)
- *Others: 3,126 (8.4%)*

Lets assume the only change is that Galloway doesn't run, and that everyone who voted for him would have voted for Leadbeater instead. The total number of voters remains at 37,659, and the split now looks like this:

- Labour (Leadbeater): 21,560 (57.3%)
- Conservative (Stephenson): 12,973 (34.4%)
- *Others: 3,126 (8.4%)*

So a much more comfortable win for Labour it would seem. In fact, percentage wise, this would have been the biggest victory for Labour in this seat since Tracy Brabin claimed 86% of the vote in the 2016 by-election. For multiple reasons of course, the 2016 by-election is not a good yardstick for the seat. 

In any case, the 2021 by-election saw a lower than average turnout. With the exception of the 2016 by-election, the seat has always drawn a turnout of over 60%, often closer to 70%. This compared to this year's 47%.

## Labour still won
