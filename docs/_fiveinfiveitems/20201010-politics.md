There's a lot happening in the world at the moment. Like, __a lot__. The thing that caught my eye recently though was not relate to COVID or the US election, but Brexit. Nah, I'm just kidding. I haven't seen anything about Brexit.

What has been apparent recently though - not least because the BMJ have [released their report](https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1932) - is how woeful the UK has been at responding to COVID-19. We have had [the highest number of deaths](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/11/coronavirus-world-map-which-countries-have-the-most-covid-cases-and-deaths) of any "Western" country outside of the United States. In fact, we're currently 5th overall, with only the US, Brazil, India, and Mexico ahead of us. Want to know what all of those countries have in common? They all have much higher populations than we do.

I was in Scotland a little while ago, and the difference between how they deal with the virus and London is insane. Track and Trace everywhere, masks in all public places, people actually paying attention to the health and wellbeing of others. Compare that to your average tube ride in London, where you're more likely to see someone wearing their mask as a neck-warmer than covering their face.

It remains to be seen whether this new three level system makes a difference. Hopefully it mean's we'll do better than "too little, too late, too flawed".
