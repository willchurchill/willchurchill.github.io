Over the last couple of months I've really struggled with my mental health. Struggled to the point where I've needed medical intervention. Unfortunately, that support was not at all easy to come by. I've struggled with being seen in the past - including being on a local waitlist for a therapist so long that by the time they called me I'd moved cities twice and jobs thrice. But this was a whole other level.

It's something I navigated in part because I've had to navigate it before. But it wasn't easy - and not just from a bureaucracy point of view. The number of times I had to explain my story to people left me mentally and emotionally drained. like I say, I've had to do it before. But with the current pandemic, and some people all over the country now more in need of emotional and mental support than ever before, I struggle to understand how many of them are going to make it through to actual support.

In lieu of anything else to do, I decided to write a letter to Matt Hancock. [You can read it here.](https://willchurchill.co.uk/letters/open-letter-to-matt-hancock/)
