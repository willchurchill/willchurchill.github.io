The Honours list was annouced last weekend, and amidst the usual fanfare for B and C list celebrities, we also saw the highest number of awards for those in the social sector, for doctors, and for people from minority ethnic backgrounds.

This is all wonderful, but more interesting is that because there is now a critical mass of these things, there are also more conversations happening about this.

Short entry on social sector this week, because this is something I definitely want to explore in more detail. Watch this space...
