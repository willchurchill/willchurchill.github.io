An interesting story caught my eye this week regarding mobile phones. Ofcom have ruled that from December 2021, UK networks will be [banned from selling locked phones](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21535957/uk-ofcom-locked-carrier-phone-ban-ee-vodafone-tesco-mobile). While some carriers sell unlocked as standard, some of the largest providers still require manual unlocking of the handsets.

It'll be interesting to see what, if any, impact this has on consumer choice. Ofcom's research says that over a third of people decide to stay with a network because it's too difficult to unlock their phone. You'd therefore assume that the sale of "SIM only" contracts in 2022 would increase, as customers come to the end of their contracts with one provider and then take their perfectly servicable phone to another for a cheaper deal. If I were in the marketing department of O2, I'd already be planning a "get 2 months free when you bring your old phone over" on a 12 month Simplicity contract.
