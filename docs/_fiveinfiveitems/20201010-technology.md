Apps have been in the news a lot this week. "A lot" for something that isn't COVID-19, or the US Presidential race, anyway. In particular, Apple has had yet another slap on the wrist for its actions against Epic Games.

The summary of events, for those unaware but interested, is that Epic Games (distributer of, amongst other things, the widely popular Fortnite games) have taken umbrage with Apple's demands of 30% revenue made via purchases on apps in its store. Epic claims this is an exercising of monopoly powers, as the App Store is the only way of getting content onto an iOS device. To try and circumvent this, Epic added a separate payment option online that would stop the user having to pay via the App Store. Apple in turn banned Fortnite from the App Store, citing a breach of terms.

Apple's line is basically that in allowing Epic to do this, it sets a precedent that could be used to insert code on to people's phones without prior review by Apple. This could lead to malicious code being uploaded without a way of Apple stopping it. Meanwhile, we're all still using TikTok apparently, so it seems [unlikely that user security](https://www.boredpanda.com/tik-tok-reverse-engineered-data-information-collecting/) is Apple's sole concern. In fact, Apple's refusal to allow cloud gaming apps, regardless of their own review policies, does not lend any support to Apple's outward aims.

Anyway, a judge [recently ruled](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21949772/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.118.0.pdf) that Apple should not ban Epic's developer account, but denies that it be forced to reinstate Fortnite on the App Store.

All of this might not sound interesting, but it does mark something of a watershed moment in how online store fronts are able to treat developers. I guess it remains to be seen what will happen next.
