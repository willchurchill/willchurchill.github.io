I've been thinking a lot about the cinema recently. The temporary (?) closure of Cineworld could well be the canary in the mine for the industry, and I think that's a sad thing. I wouldn't say I'm a huge cinema nerd (others might disagree), and for a lot of films I'm just as happy on my own sofa with a cup of tea as I am in front of the big screen with my popcorn.

Maybe it's COVID though, and my lack of interaction with a lot of people, but I've been missing that shared collective experience that you only really get from big events. I'm thinking specifically of the shared feeling of triumph when, after 10 years and 22 films, you finally hear the words "Avengers... Assemble". Say what you want, but that was one of the most defining moments of my cinema-going life. Those moments that are incredible in your front room, but made all the better by being a room of complete strangers with a shared passion.

Yes, Tenet was horseshit, and yes it's a shame that Bond has been delayed again, and no not everyone is a cinema fan. But I think it would be a real shame for the movie going experience to die out altogether. I've never really thought of the cinema as something particularly related to mental health, but perhaps there is something more to explore there...
