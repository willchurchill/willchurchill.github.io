I've been thinking of ways to get back into writing more content lately. As ever, it might be that small steps are the way forward. With that in mind, I've decided to try a new weekly "5 thoughts in 5 minutes" section.

The idea is that, every week, I briefly muse on 5 seperate things. I'll try to have some sort of consistency between weeks, so I'm thinking of using the following five categories:

* Politics - or, more specifically, things that are happening in current events.
* Technology - perhaps my thoughts on the latest new developments. More likely my childlike enthusiasm for the latest gadgets.
* Social Sector - something that's caught my eye in the charity / social enterprise / people-doing-good-things space.
* Mental Health - an update on where I'm at, with maybe a look at what I've been doing to maintain my headspace.
* And something else, because I arbitrarily wanted 5 things.

It probably won't be all of these things all of the time, but the aim is to get 5 out every week. As something of a stretch target, I want to pick on of these things each week and turn it into a slightly longer post. We'll see how that goes...

Anyway, enjoy this week's selection.
