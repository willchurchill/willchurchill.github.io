Sometimes you'll outgrow your current website platform. Maybe your team has upskilled and you're ready to get more hands on, or perhaps you need a platform that is a little more user-friendly. Whatever the reason, replatforming can be a daunting task and is as much about taking stock of what already exists as it is about building in new features. I've worked with many clients to ensure that the end result is not only a website they can be proud of, but that the team can hit the ground running with the new features. In many cases, WordPress is my go-to choice, giving a great mix of customisation options, whilst still being a platform that requires only a little training to make a lot of changes.
