While there are a range of CRMs out there, sometimes you need something very specific. One of my first web projects was designing and building a CRM to help a volunteer organisation track the activity of their mentors.

Built from the ground up using PHP and backed by a MySQL database, this was a site that was cheap for the organisation to run, and modular enough to allow for exapansion. The site included a graphical UI and textual analysis, to allow staff to track trends and better provide for the mentees.
