**With Elon Musk completing his takeover of Twitter, tens of thousands of people have started to explore Mastodon - a microblogging site / social media platform / Twitter clone on steroids. Ever one to explore new (either new-new or new-to-me) things, now seemed like a good time to take a look.**

I was actually on Mastodon *before* this whole thing. You wouldn't know my handle though... They go to another school...

[Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) has been around since 2016, and what I'm not going to do in this post is pretend like I can speak with any authority on the platform. I did *technically* create an account in the Fediverse before the October influx. But I did it in August. And I never posted. Or really interacted at all.

There are plenty of great ways of understanding what Mastodon and the Fediverse are. One of the first things I read was [Kev Quirk's](https://fosstodon.org/web/@kev) blog "[How does Mastodon work?](https://kevquirk.com/how-does-mastodon-work/)". There are also great posts like [Scott Feeney's](https://fosstodon.org/web/@graue@social.coop) "[4 Twitter features Mastodon is better without](https://scott.mn/2022/10/29/twitter_features_mastodon_is_better_without/)".

So instead of treading old ground, I want to give my two cents on why I think Mastodon is the social media platform I've been missing this entire time.

## Tangent: Where did all the blogging go?

The year is 2015. You have some thoughts on a topic, so you fire up your Medium blog and you start typing away. You publish your thoughts to the ether and it is mere hours before people are sharing your post and commenting on the things you've said. There's discussion, and nuanced conversation. It's a little niche, your area of interest. But that doesn't matter - the internet is a big place, and there is room for everyone.

Fast-forward a few years and the landscape looks very different. You've long since stopped posting on Medium - the paywalls and the algorithms now favour vanishingly few topics. *"How I made $1,000 in 3 days whilst lying on a beach in Bali"*, or *"I manage 4 companies over 3 timezones - here are the 5 apps I literally could not live without"*. You're sure there must still be people interested in your niche, but it's nearly impossible to find them.

You still have things to say though. So you've taken your writing elsewhere. Maybe you have Wordpress.org account, or perhaps you're hosting your own blog. Maybe you've got a Squarespace or Wix page that you use. It doesn't really matter where you *post* it, you've decided, it's about where you *share* it. Not Facebook - you're a content creator, and you've been burned by Zuckerberg's lies before. And besides, the joy of the internet is in connecting with people you *don't* know in real life. LinkedIn posts seem like they get traction - but you're not really talking about "business things". 

So you default to Twitter. And that goes well enough. You're good with hashtags and your posts get a modest amount of views. You get hearts and retweets, and quote tweets proclaiming "this!" with a fire emoji. But there's no conversation. The dialogue has gone. What little back-and-forth you have with people is limited - either physically by the character limit or, you suspect, more by a lack of true engagement. You miss that sense of community of early-days Medium. Or of Blogger / Tumblr / LiveJournal / the late 2000s - early 2010s blogosphere. Some days, you even pine for MySpace (well, maybe not).

In the back of your mind, you can't help but think "maybe blogging just isn't a thing average people do anymore".

## Back to what I like about the Fediverse

I've been on Mastodon "properly" for less than 24 hours, but already I love it. It feels much more like the communities I've been missing. I've not done much actual interacting yet, but seeing things cross my timeline, and the discussions and discourse that follows them makes me remember why the internet was created in the first place.

The nature of the platform - it's independent and interconnected nature - makes it exactly suited to the kind of internet that I've been missing. A place where you can wear your different hats without being lost in the space between them. Where you can have conversations - actual discourse - with people who share your interests. Each corner of the Fediverse has it's own function, but that doesn't mean you are locked in to just that one space.

I haven't been active on Twitter for over a year. For me, it's been a fatigue with the platform in part due to a sense that you have to really shout to be heard over the noise and the algorithm. My account's still active. I doomscroll as much as the next person. But I haven't posted, liked, or retweeted in over a year. 

Maybe it's the novelty of something new that's broken me out of that funk. Or maybe it's being able to login and scroll through other people's tech projects, or news on the latest Open Source software, without having to also wade through whatever the platform thinks is important.

And none of that talks about the way the communities are run. [Fosstodon](https://hub.fosstodon.org/about/), one example, is managed by volunteers and funded by donations (as most of the Fediverse is). Funds surplus to operating requirements are donated to various Open Source projects, voted on by Patrons.

## Will this one last?

I'm already seeing posts from seasoned Mastodonians about how the influx of people from the Twitter is changing what they see on their various timelines. I'm also aware that I'm part of the problem. Like the person who buys a new-build house on the edge of a market town and then complains that all the local charm is being overrun by Gails bakeries, I've come to a place to enjoy something that benefitted in part from being hidden away.

But I'm optimistic. For one thing, a benefit the federated universe is that it becomes more straightforward to move along if things are no longer what you need them to be. I can't lift my posts, followers, likes, etc from Twitter to Facebook. But if I decide to move from one corner of the Fediverse to another, I can do that with relatively little hassle. That seems like a negative way of looking at it ("well if it starts to suck, I'll move on"), but actually what that means is that communities seem to be much more resilient. You're not trapped in the ecosystem, so you focus on the interactions not the platform.

In any case, the ideals of the Fediverse are ones that I've missed - without even realising that's what I was missing. So, for now at least, as well as the "usual" places, you can also find me over on [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/@willrc) - a server for people interested in technology, and specifically Free & Open Source software.
