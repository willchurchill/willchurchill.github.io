## What is a CDN and how do they work?

This is a test to see how Chromebooks handle git commands

And to see what it does on the way back

one more time with the script

and finally again from the CB

## How much will it cost?

## Are there Privacy / Data Security considerations?

Well, I've put the question here, so I'm probably not going to write "no". CDNs work by routing traffic through their servers. What that means is that they 

The flipside is that CDNs by their nature also provide security by not allowing users to directly access your site. It gets a bit trickier if you have SSL connections to consider (and, even if you don't have "sensitive" data, [you should consider SSL]()

## So, should I get one?

I would certainly recommend looking at them. You might not have a global operation with thousands of site visitors every day, but if you want eyeballs on your site it should be fast. For a lot of small organisations, you can get a free [Cloud CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/#overview) account.

That said, for most small organisations, if you aren't getting a CDN as part of another package, then there are probably other ways you can spend your money that will give you a good service.

It's also true that a lot of web hosting providers have CDNs anyway, so it's a bit of a moot point. If you use a service like Squarespace, then you'll have CDNs built into the platform.
