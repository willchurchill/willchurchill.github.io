I like problem solving. I'm a web developer - it comes with the territory. If you write a piece of code and it runs correctly the first time, you've still done something wrong. One of the reasons I like coding is there is nothing more logical than a computer. Everything is a puzzle to be solved, and I enjoy the process of deconstructing the problem to find out the solution. My dad's an engineer, and both my parents are multi-lingual, so I'm not short of pedigree when it comes to figuring stuff out.

And yet at the same time, I'm distinctly uncomfortable with making mistakes. I hate it. Aside from the fact that it doesn't play nice with my underlying issues with self-worth, getting stuff wrong is just so inefficient. I mean if I get something wrong I have to do it all again. Who has time for that?

So I've been thinking a bit about the inconsistency in those two positions. One the one hand being so averse to failure, and yet on the other reveling in the process of understanding.
