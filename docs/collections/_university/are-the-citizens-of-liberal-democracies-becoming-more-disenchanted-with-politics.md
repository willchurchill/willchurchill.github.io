There is a growing sense that our political system is a flawed one. On the first page of his book, Why do we hate politics, Colin Hay remarks that there seems to be a ‘near universal’ distain for anything we describe as ‘political’. He goes on to write that ‘politics’ has ‘become a dirty word’. (Hay 2007, p1)
Looking at recent events, it is not hard to see why. Perhaps most prominent in the minds of UK citizens recently, is the issue of the MPs expenses scandal. A vast number of MPs were found to be abusing a system that was put in place to provide them with nothing more than a way of claiming back on personal expenditures that they incurred whilst performing their duties as members of parliament. Instead, at a cost to the taxpayer, claims were put forward for such things as flat screen TVs, and refurbishing second homes. (BBC News 2009)

Whether or not such events have directly led to a growing distrust in politics, there is evidence to show that voter turnout for elections among liberal democracies have been falling, consistently, for the past 4 or 5 decades. This is such an important point because, as Hay writes: “Elections lie at the heart of the liberal democratic conception of politics”. It is the point in time where political participation of the public is at its highest, and when the public have the most say. Obviously, in a democracy, this is a highly important point.
However, consistent though this decline may be, it cannot be said to be particularly rapid. Between 1970 and 2005, average turnout in OEDCs fell by less than a quarter of a percentage point a year. (Hay 2007, p12-13)

Furthermore, the last US election actually saw an increase in voter turnouts (an increase of 5 million people from the 2004 election). One thing in particular that was noted about this increased turnout was the proportionately higher number of young voters present. 49% of registered voters aged 18-24 voted in the 2008 elections, compared with 47% in the 2004 elections. (US Census Press Release 2009) 
A similar trend can be seen with regards to first-time voter registration figures in the 2010 UK elections, though as the election has not happened yet it is obviously hard to tell whether or not the increase in registered voters will lead to an proportionate increase in voter turnout. 

So while there appears to be a ‘disenchantment’ of some kind, it might not necessarily be with politics itself. To go back to the MPs expenses scandal in the UK, while the situation highlighted the loopholes in the law that made such events possible, the majority of the focus was placed on the individual MPs themselves. It is perhaps the politicians – rather than the politics – that are suffering from the public’s loss of favour. Research has shown that nearly 60% of European citizens believe that ‘very few’, or ‘hardly any’ politicians care about what the public think. Furthermore, comparisons between the legal system and politicians, has the latter fairing badly. At the most cynical end of the spectrum, nearly 12% of Europeans have ‘no trust at all’ in politicians, compared with less than 6% who share the same view of the legal system. At the other end of the scale, 2.8% has ‘complete trust’ in the legal system, compared with only 0.3% who completely trust politicians. (Stoker 2006, p120-121)

There is further evidence to suggest that it is the politicians not being trusted. Hague and Harrop discovered that, since the 1960s and 70s, voting styles have changed. In both the US and Europe before this time, voting was an ‘ingrained habit’, leading an individual to vote for a party based more, seemingly, on their upbringing than any of the party’s manifesto points – a phenomenon coined ‘party identification’ in the US. In the last few decades however, while there is evidence to suggest that voter turnout has declined, people started to vote, not based on party loyalties, but on specific issues. (Hague and Harrop 2007, p203-205)

A similar phenomenon can be seen in the rise in single issue campaigns, and the increased interest in groups dealing with specific agendas (such as Oxfam and Greenpeace). This suggests that people have a strong idea of what it is that they want to see happening, and have decided that there are other ways to get things done than watching Westminster mishandle the task.

All of this does not mean that people are losing faith in politics. The disenchantment – for it is clear that a disenchantment of some sort exists – may well only be for the politicians themselves. Methods have changed, but in the sense that it is a tool to see certain ends reached, people appear to be as enchanted with politics as ever.
