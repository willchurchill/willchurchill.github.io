Mercantilists, otherwise known as ‘economic nationalists’ or ‘statists’, are seen as the chief advocates of the idea that international trade is a zero-sum game. One of the core beliefs, particularly of mercantilism, is that a country’s wealth is only measured by the amount of gold and silver it owns. Therefore, because there is only a finite amount of gold and silver in the world, if one nation takes more it must mean that other nations have less. Thus, states must ‘secure [their] interests by blocking the economic interests of other states’. (O’Brien and Williams 2010, p.17) A zero-sum game, then, is one where the gains of one nation come at the direct cost of others.

In the 17th century, philosopher Thomas Hobbes used the notion of a ‘state of nature’ to describe a hypothetical world with no political or economic authority. In his book Leviathan, he famously stated that such an existence would be “nasty, brutish, and short” and would be unable to sustain any form of industry (Macpherson 1985, p.186). Realists use Hobbes’ ideas of anarchy to describe how the world operates on a global level. In other words there is no system of governance beyond that of the individual states. Forms of realism (mercantilism included) state that formal authority is needed to “constrain the pursuit of self-interest” or else we will see the state of nature (Crane and Amawi 1997, p.5). States must compete with each other to obtain security and power. Free-market economies do not work, they argue, so instead realists follow ideas of ‘self-help’ – the notion that ‘no other state can be relied upon to guarantee [your country’s] survival’. (Dunne and Schmidt 2008, pp.100-3)

Mercantilism was most prominent between the 15th and 18th century. But even in more modern times, where we have moved away from wealth backed by gold and given way to fiat currency (thereby effectively ensuring there is no longer a finite amount of wealth in the world), traces of mercantilist thought can still be found.

The idea of protectionism, its supporters argue, is needed to safeguard domestic industries in the face of overseas competition. Protectionism is mostly seen in the form of ‘barriers to trade’; usually either tariffs (a tax by the importing country on goods from abroad), subsidies (payments to domestic producers to artificially lower the cost of their produce), or quotas (where limits are placed on the number of goods entering the country). (Parkin et al 2008, p.152) Naturally, this requires the view that international trade is a zero-sum game, and that it is likely to result in loses by the country in question. More specifically, if country A can export goods at a lower price than the cost of producing them in country B, then country B, assuming a free market economy, will lose out on any revenue share; country B’s loss is the direct gain of country A. In his Discourse on the Origins of Inequality, Rousseau uses the example of men hunting a deer to illustrate how man thinks principally of himself. Even if it were the case that ‘everyone was quite aware that [they] must faithfully keep to [their] post’ in order to catch the deer, Rousseau posits that if a hare was to cross one man’s path he would forsake this co-operation and the reward of the deer, and instead claim the (easier to catch) hare for himself. (Cress 1987, p.62) This parable, realists claim, can be expanded to states as well as individuals; a country’s first interest will always be itself (Dunne and Schmidt 2008, p.103). 

One of the more persuasive arguments for protectionism is the so-called ‘infant industry argument’. Industries in developing countries cannot hope to compete with the imports from the more established firms of the developed world. Protecting the domestic markets, so the argument goes, is the only way of allowing them to flourish to the point where they can actually compete on an international level. (Krugman and Obstfeld 2009, p.252) Of course, one obvious problem with this is how to determine which industries are ‘infant’, and which ones no longer need protection. As O’Brien and Williams put it:
> ‘Domestic producers are unlikely to willingly renounce the protection from which they benefit, and therefore the agreement on the point at which protection is to be discontinued may prove politically difficult even though the economic arguments are compelling.’
(2010, p.155)

In response to those free market supporters that claim protectionism harms the economy, rational choice theorists argue that the loss to the state as a result of the protectionist measures, although spread out to a large number of people, are very small. By contrast, the loss that would be sustained without the protectionist measures guarding against the zero-sum game loses would be very large. While they concede that the losses would only be sustained by a small number of firms, these small number of large loses nevertheless outweigh the large number of small losses. (O’Brien and Williams 2010, pp.32-3)

It would seem that protectionism sees enough support, even in the modern globalised world, for the idea of international trade as a zero-sum game to still hold water. In fact during recessions protectionist ideas often experience growth in popularity. During the 1973-7 recession there was a shift from specific forms of protectionism (tariffs, subsidies etc.) towards a more general ‘new protectionism using non-tariff barriers’ (in other words, the prevention of takeovers by foreign companies) (O’Brien and Williams 2010, p.161). In particular, Robert Gilpin was key to the revival of statism. He rebuked ideas of ‘transnational ideologists’, instead emphasizing ‘the importance of political and security interests in shaping economic outcomes.’ (Crane and Amawi 1997, p.173).

All of these beliefs lend weight to the idea that there is a danger associated with international trade. The fact that foreign countries can trade within your borders means that you will directly lose out on wealth. These arguments all point towards international trade as a zero-sum game.

The mercantilist ideas of trade are not without criticism however. It was Adam Smith, notably in Book IV of his The Wealth of Nations, who most famously pointed out that both sides can benefit from trade. He stated: 

> “…the exportation of gold and silver in order to purchase foreign goods, did not always diminish the quantity of those metals in the kingdom… on the contrary, it might frequently increase that quantity; because… those goods might be re-exported to foreign countries, and… might bring back much more treasure than was originally sent out to purchase them.”
(Skinner 1999b, p.8)

In fact, that both sides benefit from a transaction is a realisation that should be self-apparent. If one side thought that it was going to lose out, then surely it would not enter into the agreement at all? There would be no need to enforce the protectionist measures, because there would be no desire to trade internationally in the first place. In addition, Smith went on to refute early mercantilist claims that a country’s wealth was directly related to the amount of gold it owned (though as mentioned previously, this point was not crucial to the continuing success of the idea). Specifically, he introduced the idea of absolute advantage to show how it was that both parties can gain from trade. In The Wealth of Nations, Smith used an example of a pin factory to explain how the division of labour can make a workforce more productive (Skinner 1999a, pp.109-10). Adapting this idea, he showed how countries can become more productive if they specialise in a given good and then trade internationally, rather than trying to be self sufficient. The theory of absolute advantage proved that trade was a beneficial thing to both parties, thus showing that international trade was not a zero-sum game.

But still there were critics of the theory of absolute advantage; among other claims, many questioned the notion that both sides in a transaction can make a profit (O’Brien and Williams 2010, p.151). Furthermore if we suppose, in our theoretical two-good-two-country economy, that one country enjoys an absolute advantage in producing both goods, then trade would be seemingly unnecessary. But the 19th century political economist David Ricardo realised that there was still room for greater efficiency, even in this case. His idea was that of comparative advantage, where a country produces only that good which it can do so most cheaply, or rather the good that it can produce at the lowest opportunity cost. The term opportunity cost is used by economists to express the cost of one thing (in this case producing good A) in terms of the next best alternative (producing good B). (Krugman and Obstfeld 2009, pp.28-9) Because the economy requires both goods, the other is produce by another country. Trade not only takes place but is necessary, and the overall effect is a net increase in consumption (a direct measure of wealth), because the resources of both countries are being used more effectively. Again, trade in this case is not zero-sum. In fact, the theory of comparative advantage tells us that trade in these cases always increases productivity; and that this is the whole point of international trade. (Perloff 2009, p.144)

However, even comparative advantage is not without its critics. The modern world is often described as becoming more ‘globalised’, a term that economist Joseph Stiglitz defines as: 

> "… the closer integration of countries and peoples of the world which has been brought about by the enormous reduction of costs of transportation and communication, and the breaking down of artificial barriers to the flows of goods, services, capital, knowledge, and (to a lesser extent) people across borders." 
(2002, p.9)

Because comparative advantage assumes labour as the only factor of production, and furthermore it assumes this factor is fixed, it has been argued that comparative advantage can no longer apply in a modern mobile world, if ever it could. Certainly, if Stiglitz’s view on globalisation is to be believed, the global economy is becoming ever more inter-dependant, and having variable factors of production is a key part of that. This argument against comparative advantage, therefore, is a well placed one. However, in the 1970s two Swedish economists, Eli Heckscher and Bertil Ohlin, developed a theory to show a more realistic view of international trade. The model demonstrates how two economies more efficiently survive by each producing a good and trading with another economy, much as the theory of comparative advantage does. However the Heckscher-Ohlin model takes into account other factors of production, and the proportions in which they occur in each economy, making it much more relevant. (Krugman and Obstfeld 2009, p.54) While economists admit that the Heckscher-Ohlin model is not perfect, and empirical evidence to support it is mixed, it is still regarded as one of the most useful tools in international trade theory. (Krugman and Obstfeld 2009, p.82)

When all the factors are taken into consideration, it seems difficult to agree with the notion that international trade is a zero-sum game. A zero-sum game, as mathematically defined, is when the costs of a transaction are taken away from its benefits leaving a total of zero. If this were an accurate description of the outcome of international trade then, aside from the criticisms put forth by Smith, Ricardo, and others, logically no nation would undertake it as they would see no benefit. For this reason, and for the others stated previously, international trade is a non-zero-sum game. However, if we look at what is inferred by the label ‘positive-sum’, specifically a more comprehensive – ‘less-mathematical’ – definition, then we might find it hard to reconcile the idea of international trade with this, more qualitative, description. For instance, it can be described as a situation where no one wins at another’s expense. In this case the issue becomes more clouded. How does one define the expense of the other party, for example? While both parties indeed gain from trade, it is often the case that one side gains far more than the other. Certainly, there is evidence to suggest that international trade serves only to increase the gap between the rich and the poor nations. (Glenn 2007, p.175) The question then becomes to what extent each party benefits.

Marxists hold the view that developing countries see only a small portion of investment compared with the already developed nations. Globalization, and international trade in particular, is a product of capitalism and as such exacerbates the divide between the core and the periphery (in other words, the divide between the workers in the developing nations and the wealthy corporations in the developed world) (Smith et al 2008, p.7). More specifically, while trade does create a net benefit, it mainly serves the countries that are already industrialised; the trade only rewards developing countries with a much smaller amount of the investment. (Glenn 2007, p.72) Critics of the World Trade Organisation are no stranger to this idea, and have often condemned the organisation’s actions citing them as promoting too much of a ‘survival of the fittest’ economy (Perloff 2009, pp.344-5). 

But even by this argument, the poorer countries are still becoming wealthier. In fact, advocates of free trade argue against the Marxist standpoint that trade exploits the developing world. Higher demand for goods from foreign countries equates to a higher demand for that country’s labour. This in turn can push up the wages of the labourers. (Parkin et al 2008, p.157) Thus, unfair though the situation may appear to be, international trade can still not be considered zero-sum. 

Taking all of the above into consideration, it seems logical to conclude that international trade is not a zero-sum game. Despite the possible exploitation by one county of another, those countries are nevertheless getting wealthier. Furthermore, wealth is no longer measured by way of gold and silver, meaning that the traditional ideas of mercantilism – and its view of trade as a zero-sum game – are no longer valid. Modern views of a free-market economy in a globalised world seem much more in keeping with the idea that international trade is a positive-sum game.
