Within political circles, 'equality' has become something of a taboo word. The problem is that, in our modern western society of individualistic wants, equality has, in the eyes of some, become associated with the notion of giving money to those who have not 'earned' it. Even in philosophy the term has come under scrutiny, with philosophers arguing that it focuses our attention on the wrong things. Rather than valuing the idea that everyone has the “equal shares of good things”, they argue, we should instead realise that “what matters […] is that everybody has enough...” (Swift 2007, pp91-2)

Despite this, or perhaps because of it, 'equality of opportunity' has become the “acceptable face of equality” (Swift 2007, p98). But even this has its problems, chief among which is the fact that 'equality of opportunity' can in fact mean many different things (this is perhaps why it has become so appealing to politicians). While Mason suggests that the main idea of equality of opportunity is “to create a level playing-field” for the selection process of 'advantaged social positions' (2004, p368), others claim that it merely requires such a position be obtained through open competition.

In an attempt to clarify 'equality of opportunity', Swift discussed three main categories: the 'minimal' (or 'simple') view, the 'conventional' view, and the 'radical' view. Briefly, they are as follows: the simple view refers to a situation where arbitrary criteria such as race and gender do not affect an individuals chance at an opportunity, the conventional view (which goes one stage further) requires that individuals all have the same chance at acquiring the skills that applicants should be selected on, while the radical view argues that it should be an individuals choices (and nothing else) that should be the determinant. (2007, pp99-101)

The ideas of equality of opportunity are usually explained in the context of a job interview, to illustrate the different degrees to which each category differentiates the individuals.

The minimal view, as described by Swift, is simply where “a person's race or gender or religion should not be allowed to affect their chances of being selected for a job...”. However, even this 'simple view' of equality of opportunity suffers from several drawbacks. Chiefly, the simple view focuses purely on the selection process, and ignores how the individual was brought up.

To illustrate why this is a problem, Williams, in 'The idea of Equality', imagines a society that values an elite warrior class of great strength, members of which were previously recruited from only the wealthy families. There has been pressure to make the selection process fairer, and so warriors are now chosen by means of a competition of physical strength. Anyone can enter this competition, and because of this it satisfies the simple view of equality of opportunity. However, the warriors are still only being selected from the wealthy families. The reason for this, it is suggested, is that the poor families are undernourished and thus not as physically strong as those from wealthier backgrounds. So while the selection process can be deemed fair, in that anyone is able to compete for the position, the simple view lacks the ability to recognise inherent biases in the system. (Williams p100) As Swift puts the problem:
“...equality of opportunity requires more than that peoples competences […] determine whether or not they get [the positions] they apply for. It matters also that all have an equal chance of acquiring those relevant competences.”
(Swift 2007, p100)

Consequently, the 'conventional' view of equality of opportunity is seen by many as more comprehensive. In (perhaps) its more extreme guise it advocates the redistribution of resources, such that society arrives at a 'level playing field'.

However, just as with the simple view, there are problems. Even with the conventional view, one of the issues is that a 'true' level playing field requires that the successes (or failures) of the previous generation be ignored. Put more formally, this means there would need to be 'equality of outcome' which, paradoxically, presents a very different idea of equality to that of equality of opportunity. In his work on equality, Arneson describes the world as divided into “haves and have-nots”, and states that the differences in resources between these two distinctions is enormous. Egalitarians (those who support equality of outcome), he states, claim it would be “a morally better state of affairs if everyone enjoyed the same level of social and economic benefits”, rather than there be a vast disparity of resources between the rich and the poor. Thus he is advocating the ideas of equality of outcome, whereby everyone has the same level of resources. He gives three types of resources: free-time, income and wealth, and the freedom to use the goods one possess. (pp489-91)

It becomes clear that, while the equalities of opportunity and outcome are both similar in name, the two notions are seemingly incompatible. It seems difficult to arrive at a situation where both equality of opportunity and equality of outcome can  be satisfied. In fact, by its very nature, equality of opportunity will will produce inequalities of outcome.

So, if the two theories are incompatible, the question becomes whether or not equality of opportunity is a better way of assessing equality. Clearly, this is a matter of conjecture and the answer will depend on to who you ask the question. Arneson, for example, writes:

> “...it would be unfair to compensate an individual in the name of equality for a deficit in the welfare outcome she reaches if it lay within her control to have reached higher welfare outcomes. The objection then is urging that as egalitarians we should be concerned to render equal the opportunities that people enjoy rather than the outcomes that people reach by voluntary choice among opportunities.”
(Arneson p494)

What Arneson is arguing is that equality of opportunity is a 'fairer' assessment of equality, even if it means that people will ultimately end up with different outcomes. The main reason for this is that egalitarians see freedom of choice as the most important factor.

Furthermore, Arneson points out the difficulties in developing a system of equality of outcome. He uses an example where a system of equality of functioning is based on the standards of the Roman Catholic Church. Clearly, if this were to be used as a method of redistributing goods, many citizens, presumably the non-Roman Catholics, would see this as unacceptable. (p495)

> “Some people are against equality of opportunity. Peter Singer, for instance, says that it rewards the lucky and penalises the unlucky; John Schaar, who regards the whole idea as a cruel deception, claims that it entrenches the inequalities of the status quo, makes people feel their failure is their own, and cheats them into thinking they have a chance to achieve what they could never possibly achieve.” (Richards 1998, p52)

> “Anyhow, in what sense do young white males 'pay,' · for reverse discrimination? They do less well than they might have done under, say, fair equality of opportunity; but under that system women and black people do less well than they would under reverse discrimination. In any inegalitarian structure, someone 'pays' for others to do better. It's no worse for white man to do the paying than for someone else to do it. ” (Baker 1987, p52)
