The term ‘globalization’ is one that can have a number of subtly different definitions. In an economic sense, is the expression given to the way that countries are becoming more interdependent on one another for a variety of needs. To use the words of Steve Smith et al. globalization is “the process of increasing interconnectedness between societies such that events in one part of the world more and more have effects on peoples and societies far away” (2008, p.8). Anthony Giddens meanwhile, defines globalization as “…the intensification of worldwide social relations which link distant localities in such a way that local happenings are shaped by events occurring many miles away and vice versa.” (cited in Glenn 2008, p.23). Almost invariably, the definitions of ‘globalization’ focus on an increase, or a deepening, of relationships between different parts of the globe.

The reasons for globalization occurring are numerous, though some are perhaps more influential than others. Technological advancements are often cited as the main contributor to this increased interconnectedness, markedly the advent of the internet moving into the public realm. Since technology has become cheaper and more accessible, more and more people are able to communicate on a global scale with much greater ease than before.
Liberalism supports this notion, suggesting that this ease of communication has led to the fall of certain barriers; “states are no longer sealed units” (Smith et al. 2008, p.7). Further to this, liberalists believe that with the breaking down of the barriers between states, other non-state actors can emerge and exert their own influence.

Another of the ideals that liberalists hold is that of the free market. This is when the price and allocation of resources is decided purely by the level of supply and the level of demand for a product. In other words, the government (or governments) does not interfere by means of subsides (or indeed taxation), or by otherwise influencing the market. This idea holds for international as well as domestic trading, and in theory will benefit society as a whole. Institutions such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO) have been set up for the purpose of promoting free trade to better benefit the economies of its member states.
However, the WTO (and free trade itself) has been criticised for harming the efforts of farmers in developing countries. Because free trade creates a ‘survival of the fittest’ economy, poorer farmers who are not able to invest in expensive technologies to produce cheaper goods are priced out of the market by international trade. (Perloff 2009, p.344-5). 

Marxism agrees with this criticism. According to Marxist theories, globalization is a product of capitalism and, as such, simply exacerbates the divide between the core and periphery (Smith et al. 2008, p.7). Many have speculated that while globalization, and more specifically the increase in international trade and investment, does create a kind of net benefit, it mainly serves countries that are already more industrialised. Those countries that are still developing receive a much smaller amount of investment. In other words, globalization benefits the core rather than the periphery (Glenn 2007, p.72). Thus, by this argument, globalization does not reduce global poverty.

One thing that must be remembered when making this judgement, however, is that this increase in wealth is relative. Simply because the western states are receiving a higher proportion of the increase in wealth, does not mean to say that the less developed countries are not receiving any of the wealth. What we must establish then is what we mean by the term ‘poverty’.

It seems that the generally accepted definition of ‘poverty’ focuses on “… a situation where people do not have the money to buy adequate food or satisfy other basic needs…” (Thomas 2008, p.471). Definitions such as these have been criticised however for being too heavily based on ideas of money – something that is a very western view. The United Nations (UN) has attempted to address these criticisms, and have defined poverty thus: 

>“…the total absence of opportunities, accompanied by high levels of undernourishment, hunger, illiteracy, lack of education, physical and mental ailments, emotional and social instability, unhappiness, sorrow and hopelessness for the future. Poverty is also characterized by a chronic shortage of economic, social and political participation, relegating individuals to exclusion as social beings, preventing access to the benefits of economic and social development and thereby limiting their cultural development.”
(Blanco 2002, [online])

With this more comprehensive definition in mind, it could be argued that the spread of globalization and, by association, certain western standards, means that some people are now able to have such things as an education and are thus ‘less poor’, even though they may not achieve the same financial gains.
In practice however, this does not seem to be the case. Tim Dunne makes reference to the fact that in parts of Africa children have to pay to receive basic education (Booth and Dunne 1999, cited in Dunne 2008, p.118), and John Glenn, while conceding that education is a “positive factor for promoting growth in developing countries”, also points out that it is a considerable factor in the growing income disparity (2007, p.175).

In conclusion, the answer to the question ‘Does Globalization reduce or increase global poverty?’ is a complex one. In purely monetary terms, the world has become a richer place, however the gap between the rich and the poor has also widened. While it is true that globalization and an increase in trade has generated a vast amount of wealth and has resulted in many businesses flourishing, it has caused a great many more to go bankrupt. It is argued that “business and jobs lost in one sector are more than offset by gains in other sectors” (Perloff 2009, p.344) but the reallocation of these gains does not benefit everyone equally.

Consequently, while there is a lot to be gained from the interconnectedness of states, there is a great deal of evidence to suggest that globalization has, thus far, increased global poverty.
