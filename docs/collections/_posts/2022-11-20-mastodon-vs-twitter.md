A week or so ago, I posted that [I had joined Mastodon]({{site.url}}/musings/yes-im-on-mastodon-now-too/). In it, I very wisely decided to not comment on a platform that I didn't know a huge amount about. Here, I ignore my own sound advice.

## What is the Fediverse and what is Mastodon?

The Fediverse (or Federated Universe) is a catch-all term for platforms that all share the same protocol, and allows users on one instance to communicate with users on other instances. Mastodon is one of the more popular uses of the Fediverse. Touted as a Twitter-clone, it's a microblogging platform that allows users to join one of hundreds of servers, based on their personal / professional interests. Joining one server does not stop you from following users on other servers and interacting with them.

Imagine if you could read and comment on your aunty's Facebook post from your Pinterest account. It's a little like that.

## Sound's great. Why aren't we all doing this?

Great question, hypothetical reader! It looks like there are a few reasons. One of which is that, from a theoretical point of view, it seems to be hard for people to wrap their heads around. There's also not the same ease that you can join other social media platforms with - because there is an immediate sense of FOMO that you might get by joining the "wrong" server. Lastly, because of the federated nature, it does take time and effort to curate your list of followed accounts across various servers.

## So Twitter is better then? Or at least easier to use?

There are things I still really like about Twitter. I've been on the platform (in various levels of engagement) for over 12 years, and some things about the platform are so second nature to me that to not have them seems strange.

Twitter lists are 

- **Split of timelines** - You have three: **Home**, **Local** and **Federated**. And all of them show you posts in chronological order (remember that?!).

Home is what you think your Twitter timeline *should* be. In other words, it is posts from people you follow (regardless of what server they are on). That's it. Anything they've posted, or anything they have Boosted, nothing more, nothing less.

Local shows you all of the posts from people on your server. Because you've likely picked a server that aligns with one of your interests, this is a good way to keep in touch with that interest. Sure, not everyone is posting about that thing all the time, but it broadly gives you a more targeted experience than Twitter could achieve (without lists)

Federated shows you all the posts from all the users in all the servers that your instance is federated with. This one is a little more complicated to wrap your head around. In simple terms, if I'm on Server A, and I follow someone from Server B, then Server A and B become "federated", and all of the posts on Server B now show up on the Federated timeline of all Server A's users (and vice-versa).

- **You can't 'Quote Boost'** - When you Boost something, you just air it on your platform. You can't add commentary to it, you can't opine on it. You just post it to your feed.
- **Favouriting something doesn't add it to your Feed** - This is one of those things that makes sense if you use Twitter in a specific way. I didn't like to use it in that way, so the fact that favouriting something made it appear on my feed always bugged me. There's none of that in Mastodon. If I favourite a post, it's for the benefit of the author.
- **You can add whatever you want to your profile** - Using meta tags, you can add as much detail to your profile as you want. Most commonly, people use them to signpost to otherplaces on the internet that they exist.
