A week or so ago, I posted that [I had joined Mastodon]({{site.url}}/musings/yes-im-on-mastodon-now-too/). In it, I very wisely decided to not comment on a platform that I didn't know a huge amount about. Here, I ignore my own sound advice.

## What is the Fediverse and what is Mastodon?

Other people cover this very well, including [this epicly detailed post](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-11-03_what-i-know-about-mastodon/) from Danielle Navarro, but for a quick run through here is what you need to know:

- The Fediverse (or Federated Universe) is a catch-all term for a series of platforms that all share the same protocol. This allows users on one instance to communicate with users on other instances basically seamlessly. Imagine if you could read and comment on your aunty's Facebook post from your Pinterest account. It's a little like that. Sort of.
- Mastodon is one of the more popular uses of the Fediverse. If you like bad analogies, it's a Twitter-clone. In actuality, it's a microblogging platform that allows users to join one of hundreds of servers, based on their personal / professional interests, and each governed by its own set of policies. 
- Joining one server does not stop you from following people on other servers and interacting with them. 

## Sound's great. Why aren't we all doing this?

Great question, hypothetical reader! It looks like there are a few reasons. Conceptually it's a little tricky for some to understand - the reasons why might become clear in a moment. 

I think there's also a marketing issue - people often refer to "Mastodon" being difficult to set up, or having a wait list to join. It's like saying email is difficult - an email *provider* might be difficult, in the same way a Mastodon server might be difficult. But one person's experience of a particular server might lead them to think Mastodon is not worth the effort, whilst someone else remains unaware and unaffected on an entirely different server.

That does lead onto a related issue though, which is that there is a higher barrier to entry to "Mastodon" - precisely because you can't "join Mastodon" in the same way you join Twitter or Instagram. You have to pick a server, and even if you accept that there is still the fear that you might miss something by joining the "wrong" server. 

Lastly, because of the federated nature, it does take time and effort to curate your list of followed accounts across various servers. Again, precisely because of the federated nature of the platform there are certain hoops to jump through that just aren't there with some other platforms.

## So Twitter is better then? Or at least easier to use?

There are things I still really like about Twitter. I've been on the platform (in various levels of engagement) for over 12 years, and some things about the platform are so second nature to me that to not have them seems strange.

But there are things about Mastodon that I am really enjoying. One of these is the split of timelines. There are three: **Home**, **Local** and **Federated**. And all of them show you posts in chronological order (remember that?! remember ***chronological order***).

- **Home** is what you think your Twitter timeline *should* be. In other words, it is posts from people you follow (regardless of what server they are on). That's it. Anything they've posted, or anything they have Boosted, nothing more, nothing less. ("Boosted" is the Mastodon term for sharing someone else's post - analogous to Retweets on Twitter)
- **Local** shows you all of the posts from people on your server. Because you've likely picked a server that aligns with one of your interests, this is a good way to keep in touch with that interest. Sure, not everyone is posting about that thing all the time. The experience might be similar to a curated Twitter list.
- **Federated** shows you all the posts from all the users in all the servers that your instance is federated with. This one is a little more complicated to wrap your head around. In simple terms, if I'm on Server A, and I follow someone from Server B, then Server A and B become "federated", and all of the posts on Server B now show up on the Federated timeline of all Server A's users (and vice-versa). In practical terms, this is basically a 'global' view of Mastodon.

### Other things I like

**You can't 'Quote Boost'.** When you Boost something, you just air it on your platform. You can't add commentary to it, you can't opine on it. You just post it to your feed. This is a deliberate feature, designed on the one hand to allow authors to have their views shared without someone else's lens, and on the other to reduce the amount of airtime that negative posting gets.

**Favouriting something doesn't add it to your Feed** - This is one of those things that makes sense if you use Twitter in a specific way. I don't like to use it in that way, so the fact that favouriting something made it appear on my feed always bugged me. There's none of that in Mastodon. If I favourite a post, it's for the benefit of me, and for the benefit of the author.

**You can add whatever you want to your profile** - Using meta tags, you can add as much detail to your profile as you want. Most commonly, people use them to signpost to other places on the internet that they exist. This is a tiny little quality of life thing that ultimately doesn't make or break the platform. But I think it's nice.

## So which is better?

Sadly, it doesn't work like that. I'd love to be able to tell you, dear reader. But aside from the fact that you are not me, and therefore our opinions will likely differ, for me the actual answer comes down to what I use each platform for.

We're certainly seeing a large exodus of Twitter users - or at least a huge influx of users to the Fediverse. But I don't think Twitter is going to go anywhere soon. And much like politics of any nature, the average person probably doesn't really care about the hot mess behind the scenes. They use it to connect to their friends / peers / sector, and to maintain their own corner of the ether.

For me personally, I'm getting much more value from Mastodon than I'm currently getting from Twitter. I find it easier to engage and interact not just with individuals but also topics. The server I've joined is [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/) - which primarily discusses Free and Open Source software. I've enjoyed following along with people's software projects, and seeing insights from various tech conferences. These are all things I used to do with Twitter lists, but for me that just doesn't click as much anymore, at least not for "techy stuff". 

It's not necessarily the case with all the hats I wear - the UK Social Enterprise / Charity / Foundation space is still pretty active on the Twitter, so I tend to flit back and forth a bit. It's horses for courses, I suppose is what I'm saying.

But if you do find yourself in the Fediverse, find yourself a good server, and start engaging with people.
