Last week I went to [Computing's](https://www.computing.co.uk/) [IT Leaders Summit](https://event.computing.co.uk/itleaderssummit2023/en/page/home). Amongst other things, we talked about managing IT Security, the rise of Generative Artificial Intelligence, and what's going on with IT budgets. Here are some of the things I've taken away.

## IT spending is up

This is driven by the higher cost of essential tech, and increase in the need for IT spending, and the rising cost of SaaS (Software as a Service) and Cloud products. (If all of those sound like they mean the same thing, welcome to IT budgeting 101.)

In one of the opening talks of the Summit, Computing's John Leonard went through results of a survey the publication had conducted across the IT sector. Of the respondents, 50% reported an increase in real terms in the money they spent on IT compared to last year. Of this increase, the largest rises went to cloud infrastructure. Some organisations had reported rises of as much as 4x inflation for their licenses. While that was certainly at the higher end, the likes of Microsoft, Google, and Salesforce have or will be raising their prices by an average of 14% compared to 2022.

While actual spending is up, these are on things that individual companies don't really have much control over. If you don't want to pay the increase in license fees for your Microsoft 365 accounts, your other alternative is... Well you don't really have one. At least, not one that doesn't come with it's own large costs to migrate. What this means is that the budgets that IT professionals have to play with when it comes to the "extra stuff" is greatly diminished. Companies are concerned about upcoming fixed costs - like what happens when your current software stack goes End Of Life and you're forced to upgrade.

## Strong cyber security is more important than ever

Traditional IT security is based on a very simple concept: here is a list of known viruses, bad people, and nefarious software. If you see it, delete it. That's worked well enough for a while. But these days the problems aren't confined to virus and spam emails. Modern hackers can leverage "safe" software - genuine applications that you have on your device right now - and twist their purpose.

In a talk on Zero Trust Security Measures, [Threatlocker's](https://www.threatlocker.com/) Seamus Lennon gave the example of a company which had been a victim of a ransomware attach using an email client, Windows Powershell, and the popular 7zip application. Blocking any of these apps is functionally impossible. You can't run a company without your email client, and your Windows laptop can't run without Powershell.

You can sort of mitigate for this in a "traditional" office setup, because your IT admin can stick a fancy firewall at the gates of your office and monitor everything that comes in and out. Except very few companies post-pandemic still operate in a way that makes this a failsafe. "The biggest challenge to network security," says Lennon, "is that there is no network." With the boom in home offices, remote working, and the average person now blurring the lines between personal and professional use of their office laptop, keeping devices safe in a world where ransomware attackers can use legitimate applications to cause damage is a IT security nightmare.

## AI is... complicated

And I don't mean technically. There are a lot of things I hadn't considered about Artificial Intelligence. Did you know, for example, that the increase in access to AI makes people less likely to collaborate? Dan McMahon from [Hymans Robertson](https://www.hymans.co.uk/) made this point in a panel discussion. With AI tools cutting down on the grunt work needed for any given task, organisations are able to go further alone that they used to. Some are taking this as a sign that they don't need to collaborate - it is much easier now to strike out on your own. I'm left to wonder, though it would be very hard to objectively measure this, whether progress in certain fields has actually slowed as a result of technology?

AI is also likely to stay the purview of the privileged. Payment models for things like ChatGPT mean that the "free" version is several iterations behind what the paid plans provide. That's not exactly new as a technology costing model. But Huseyin Seker from [Birmingham City University](https://www.bcu.ac.uk/) made the point that as these costing models mature, those with resources are more likely to exponentially benefit from the technological gains that Artificial Intelligence provides. 

Taking this thought a step further, much of generative AI "learns" from itself. By which I mean the exchanges are used to help modify and improve the platform. With barriers to access excluding certain groups, does that also mean we are more likely to create self-perpetuating echo-chambers of certain opinions? 

And, spoiler alert, we're about to talk more about payment for IT services...

## Non-invasive tech is going to cost you

Recently, Meta announced they were exploring offering a [paid tier for Instagram](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/03/facebook-instagram-charge-ad-free-eu-meta-mobile-desktop) for EU users. This paid tier would mean they were not subject to targetted adverts on the platform. This is part of a drive by the EU to end the era of "if the service is free, then you're the product". On the face of it, this isn't a bad idea. The reason we can flick through Instagram reels "for free" is because the data of what we look at, like, and share is worth a lot of money to Meta. Offering a paid tier allows you to still consume user-generated content that you like, but without having your data mined and sold.

My concern is that we're going to enter an age where the ability to consume content safe from algorithmic influence is only going to be for those who can afford it. In the same way that those benefiting from - and therefore influencing the direction of - AI. Here though, my concern is less about how the platforms will be shaped by those with money. It is more about what happens to those who won't or can't pay. They will still be served those ads, and the ads will be more aggressive for it.

## Most people will experience online harm

Did you know that 62% of adults who access the internet have encountered online harm in the last week? Did you know that number goes up to 68% for 13-17 year olds? Chloe Colliver of [Ofcom](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/home), talked through some of the research that lead to the creation of the Online Safety Bill - due to be passed into law in the coming weeks.

The average person in the UK spends a little over 4 hours online every day, and of that nearly an hour is spent just on Meta apps and websites (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger). Other social media platforms, including Snap, X, and TikTok, also make up considerable amounts of time - especially for younger users. The Online Safety Bill is designed to protect UK Citizens from online harm, including illegal pornography, online trolling and other forms of verbal abuse, and certain types of internet fraud.

While a full discussion on the Bill is beyond the scope of this post, there are some things to note. It's a very complicated document that can be interpreted in a number of ways - something that critics have been eager to point out. It also seems to demand the ability to decrypt secure messages, and calls into question how anonymous one can be on the internet. Clearly there are nefarious purposes for being untraceable online, but also there are a great many reasons someone might *need* to remain anonymous (tangentially related: [this 2021 post from Anonyome Labs](https://anonyome.com/2021/04/removing-anonymity-online-would-risk-the-most-vulnerable-users/) about the risk of removing online anonymity).

That said, you can't argue with the numbers. With more young people accessing the internet more often, at a younger age, there certainly needs to be more thought put into making sure people are safe. As pricing models for everything from Generative AI to messaging apps evolve, different groups are going to be targeted for different reasons.

## Final thoughts

I continue to be a technology optimist. The benefits we can all get from advances are almost limitless. But it is just as important to remain aware of how fast moving tech can also be something to keep an eye on. We are continually putting more of ourselves online, conducting more of our business globally, and becoming more reliant on third parties to ensure our day-to-day lives run smoothly. There isn't necessarily anything wrong with that, but make sure you keep yourself up-to-date.
