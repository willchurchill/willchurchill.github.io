[Calendly](https://calendly.com/) is a popular service that allows you to sync your calendar (or calendars - because who only has one calendar these days?) and offer meeting times to clients that work for you, without the admin burden that comes from arranging and sending invites. Beyond that though, there are a number of more complicated use cases that I've helped organisations like [mydentist](https://www.mydentist.co.uk/) and [Esmee Fairbairn Foundation](https://esmeefairbairn.org.uk) setup, including using it as a booking platform for appointments, integrating it into a CRM like Salesforce, or co-ordinating meetings with multiple stakeholders in as efficient a way as possible.
