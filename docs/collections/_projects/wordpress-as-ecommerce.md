There are a range of specially built e-commerce platforms out there, but did you know that WordPress can be one of the most cost-effective ways of selling your products and services to your customers? It's a particulary good choice if you want your site to be more than just a sales platform. I've worked with many clients, either to add e-commerce to their existing WordPress site, or as with Trail and Vines, build the site fresh in WordPress to make sure they have a website that is exactly what they need - no more, and no less.
