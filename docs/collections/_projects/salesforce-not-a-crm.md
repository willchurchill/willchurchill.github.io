Salesforce is the world's leading Customer Relationship Management platform, and with good reason. With a relatively shallow learning curve for the average user, it has the ability for very heavy customisation and powerful tools for analysis and reporting. I've worked with clients looking to supplement the out-of-the-box CRM elements of Salesforce with more bespoke functions, including using it as a tool for Grants Management, for tracking appointments, and logging charitable donations.
