We're increasingly moving to a "cloud-based" working environment, with Microsoft 365 being a favourite among businesses. Beyond just collaborating on documents, Microsoft 365 offers a wide range of solutions for everything from surveying tools to inter-team communications, video conferencing options to file-storage and sharing. As part of my role at Esmee Fairbairn Foundation, I work continually on the use of Microsoft 365 to ensure that the team is trained in the best ways to use the right tools.
