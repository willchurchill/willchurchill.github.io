            <h2>Projects I've worked on</h2>
            <p>
                In no particular order (well, actually in alphabetical order based on how I've named them), here are some of the projects I've worked on over the years. This isn't a full list, but hopefully gives you an idea as to the kinds of things I might be able to help you and your organisation with. I don't make any commission or get any rewards from any of the services or platforms that are mentioned below. If I recommend something, it's because I genuinely think its the right tool for the job - and that is the only reason.

            <h2>Chrome Extensions</h2>
            <p>
                Every now and again I get a bee in my bonnet about a very specific way I like to work. Usually this is to do with how I store information. Below are a couple of Chrome Extensions I wrote to help me manage certain tasks. I offer them here completely free. These are not projects I regularly come back to, but if you have suggestions or questions about them, please do <a href="mailto:will@willrc.co.uk">get in touch</a>.
            </p>
            <h3>4321 Extension</h3>
            <p>
                This was my first publicly available Chrome Extension, which I used for a while to help me manage overwhelm in specific projects. The idea is that you can chunk tasks into blocks of 4, 3, 2, then 1 final task. You can read more about how and why I created this in my <a href="https://willrc.co.uk/musings/my-new-todo-lists/">personal blog</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to use the extension, you can find it on the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/4321-todo-extension/mmophiodbcfhifbdaklpfjdfiadgobpo">Chrome Web Store</a>.
            </p>
            <h3>NowNextLater Extension</h3>
            <p>
                I'm constantly searching for, refining, and changing the way I track tasks. More recently I've gone back to basics, and started to log tasks that I need to do Now, things that I need to do in the near future (Next), and those that I need to be aware of, but that aren't super urgent. This led me to write the NowNextLater Extension, which is currently how I keep track of tasks that aren't really part of any specific project.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you'd like to use the extension, you can find it on the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nownextlater-extension/hmeicodhjdadobfkagbmjgkpgfmdnmhj/">Chrome Web Store</a>.
