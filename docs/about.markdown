## About Will
I wear a number of hats, pretty much all of which involve using technology to support others delivering social good. 

I'm the co-founder of [Copy & Code](https://copyandcode.co.uk), the Technology Lead at [Esmee Fairbairn Foundation](https://esmeefairbairn.org.uk), a Trustee of the [School for Social Entrepreneurs](https://the-sse.org.uk), and a technology advisor for [Spark & Co.](https://sparkandco.co.uk).

## About this site
I use this site as a place to store all sorts of content from my brain. I often use writing as a way to work through what I think about specific things, and so when I've done that I put it here. I've also recently uploaded some old essays from my university days. I'll be honest, that's mostly because I'm a narcisist, and I like reading my own things - it was easier to put them on the internet than burying them in a Dropbox folder.

I also [dabble in fiction writing](/fiction/) from time to time, which breaks up the monotony of my poilitcal rants. I haven't settled on a "style" as such, but I tend to prefer shorter flash-fiction to longer writing. That isn't to say that I'm not working on something a little more ambitious though...

This blog is a flat-file site built using Jekyll, using a custom theme. You can read more about why I've opted for flat-file [here]({% post_url 2020-05-28-i-blog-in-markdown-now %}).
