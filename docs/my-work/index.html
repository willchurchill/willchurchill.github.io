		<h2>Bespoke CRM creation</h2>
		<p><p>While there are a range of CRMs out there, sometimes you need something very specific. One of my first web projects was designing and building a CRM to help a volunteer organisation track the activity of their mentors.</p>

<p>Built from the ground up using PHP and backed by a MySQL database, this was a site that was cheap for the organisation to run, and modular enough to allow for exapansion. The site included a graphical UI and textual analysis, to allow staff to track trends and better provide for the mentees.</p>

Beyond that though, there are a number of more complicated use cases that I’ve helped organisations including <a href="https://esmeefairbairn.org.uk">Esmee Fairbairn Foundation</a> and one of the UK’s largest dental practicises setup, including using it as a booking platform for appointments, integrating it into a CRM like Salesforce, or co-ordinating meetings with multiple stakeholders in as efficient a way as possible.</p>

		<p><p>While maybe not as rapidly evolving as the software industry, there is a lot to keep on top of when it comes to IT hardware. Keeping up to date with not just the latest technology, but also choosing the right price for your organisation is difficult. From servers for a multi-national company, to the right laptop for someone balancing working from home with personal use (hi Mum!), I’ve helped hundreds of people with the right choice for their hardware.</p>

		<h2>Implementing Microsoft 365</h2>
		<p><p>We’re increasingly moving to a “cloud-based” working environment, with Microsoft 365 being a favourite among businesses. Beyond just collaborating on documents, Microsoft 365 offers a wide range of solutions for everything from surveying tools to inter-team communications, video conferencing options to file-storage and sharing. As part of my role at Esmee Fairbairn Foundation, I work continually on the use of Microsoft 365 to ensure that the team is trained in the best ways to use the right tools.</p>

<p>Not every website needs to be all singing and all dancing, but that doesn’t that mean it shouldn’t be built with care. Whether you want to use a web builder, or you just want a simple text-based site, I can work with you to design, build, and even host it.</p>

With a relatively shallow learning curve for the average user, it has the ability for very heavy customisation and powerful tools for analysis and reporting. I’ve worked with clients looking to supplement the out-of-the-box CRM elements of Salesforce with more bespoke functions, including using it as a tool for Grants Management, for tracking appointments, and logging charitable donations.</p>

		<h2>WordPress as an e-commerce platform</h2>
		<p><p>There are a range of specially built e-commerce platforms out there, but did you know that WordPress can be one of the most cost-effective ways of selling your products and services to your customers? It’s a particulary good choice if you want your site to be more than just a sales platform. I’ve worked with many clients, either to add e-commerce to their existing WordPress site, or as with Trail and Vines, build the site fresh in WordPress to make sure they have a website that is exactly what they need - no more, and no less.</p>

		<h2>WordPress migration</h2>
		<p><p>Sometimes you’ll outgrow your current website platform. Maybe your team has upskilled and you’re ready to get more hands on, or perhaps you need a platform that is a little more user-friendly. Whatever the reason, replatforming can be a daunting task and is as much about taking stock of what already exists as it is about building in new features. I’ve worked with many clients to ensure that the end result is not only a website they can be proud of, but that the team can hit the ground running with the new features. In many cases, WordPress is my go-to choice, giving a great mix of customisation options, whilst still being a platform that requires only a little training to make a lot of changes.</p>

		<h2>WordPress optimisation</h2>
		<p><p>WordPress is one of the most popular platforms on the internet for managing websites. One of its greatest strengths is the ability to customise it to perform virtually any function. But, just like anything, the more you add to it the more careful you need to be about making sure it runs smoothly.</p>

<p>I’ve worked with a number of clients to make sure that they strike the balance between getting a website that does everything they need, and ensuring that their visitors still get the quick page load times and great performance they expect.</p>

<p>This was my first publicly available Chrome Extension, which I used for a while to help me manage overwhelm in specific projects. The idea is that you can chunk tasks into blocks of 4, 3, 2, then 1 final task. You can read more about how and why I created this in my <a href="https://willrc.co.uk/musings/my-new-todo-lists/">personal blog</a>.</p>

<p>I’m constantly searching for, refining, and changing the way I track tasks. More recently I’ve gone back to basics, and started to log tasks that I need to do Now, things that I need to do in the near future (Next), and those that I need to be aware of, but that aren’t super urgent. This led me to write the NowNextLater Extension, which is currently how I keep track of tasks that aren’t really part of any specific project.</p>
