            <div class="twelve columns"><p><strong><em>It’s difficult to get me to shut-up about tech, so to help channel that excitement I’ve asked people to give me specific tech questions they have. In this post I answer a question from Nick, who wants to know why people like Bill Gates are lauded, where the likes of Zuckerberg seem to get no respite from the court of public opinion.</em></strong></p>

<p>The year is 1986, and 31 year old William Henry Gates III is about to take his 11 year old software company public. Instantly he becomes a millionaire. A year later, his personal wealth tipped into the billions, and since then Bill Gates has remained one of the richest men in the world.</p>

<p>Despite leaving Microsoft in the early 2000s, Gates never really left the limelight. Aside from his Microsoft fame, his Foundation and it various medical and educational triumphs has kept Gates a household name.</p>

<p>But neither he, nor the company he founded, are without sin. Indeed, you’d be hard pushed to find any large tech mogul with a spotless record. A very good example is everyone’s favourite love-to-hate-him-whilst-still-using-all-his-products billionaire Mark Zuckerberg.</p>

<p>On paper, Gates and Zuckerberg have similar profiles. Both became astronomically wealthy at a relatively young age (“Zuck” made it to the ripe old age of 23 before he became a billionaire). Both have given vast amounts of money to philanthropic aims, both are vocal champions of specific causes, and both have been synonymous with their products in a way that some of the nerdiest nerds don’t always achieve (quick: name who founded Google) .</p>

<p>At the other end of the scale, both companies have been accused of shady practices, are known for buying out competitors and repainting it as innovation (see: Skype, WhatsApp), and have poster-child products that have at any given time been accused of: spying on users, hampering fair competition, or been responsible for the partial downfall of western civilisation.</p>

<p>So why do we revere Gates but lampoon Zuckerberg? What is it about them, or ourselves, that means one gets a hall pass while the other is under constant scrutiny.</p>

<p>Let’s dive in.</p>

<h2 id="it-was-a-different-time">It was a different time</h2>

<p>Let’s tackle the low hanging fruit first. Gates got famous in a time before the World Wide Web, and while he stuck around as Microsoft’s Chair until 2014 and as an adviser until 2020, by 2006 he was already starting to step away from day-to-day operations, choosing instead to spend his time on philanthropic endeavours, ultimately being replaced as CEO in 2008.</p>

<p>To put that timeline into context, Facebook wasn’t open to the public until 2006, which was incidentally the year that Twitter launched. It took until arguably the early 2010s for social media as a concept to really become ubiquitous, By this point the “big four” of the day - Facebook, LinkedIn, MySpace and Twitter - were all comfortably hosting tens of millions of users. Facebook, of course, eclipsing them all with well over 500 million. Later that year, Instagram would launch, seeing 1 million users within three months, and 10 million before its first birthday. Barely two years later, Instagram launched to a similar trajectory. Today, Facebook - via its own parent company, Meta - owns them both, and has recently launched Threads as the latest Twitter-killer. As of 2023, the combined user base of the Meta portfolio (including Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Threads) is a little shy of 4 billion.</p>

<p>All that is by-the-by, and possibly worthy of its own post, but the point I’m making is that we live in an age of seemingly exponential interconnectedness. And that’s important for two reasons.</p>

<p>The first is that it’s enabled the “cult of celebrity”. We’ll come back to this, because it’s an interesting phenomenon, especially when you look at “tech celebrities”.</p>

<p>The second reason this is important to note, is because Zuckerberg owns 3 of the top 5, and 5 of the top 10 most populous social media platforms <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/">on the planet</a>. To a lot of people, Mark Zuckerberg has been perhaps the most important single person in the history of modern communication.</p>

<p>And this leads us to our first reason that Zuck finds it harder to escape criticism…</p>

<h2 id="weve-become-smarter-about-data">We’ve become smarter about data</h2>

<p>As individuals, we now exist across a plethora of platforms. Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, Threads, Mastodon - these are all platforms I’m on, and I’m not exactly a poster-child for social media adoption. TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube, Twitch, Reddit, and others round off some of the most popular means of interaction in the world.</p>

<p>All of that data spread out across the ether makes for lucrative gains to be had. And when your company owns the majority of those internet spaces, it becomes harder to hide your intention.</p>

<p>Already in our lifetime we have some pretty serious evidence to show how social media is changing the fabric of our society - <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files">Cambridge Analytica</a> is one example, evidence of Russian tampering in the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-election-facebook-russia-idUSKBN25S5UC">2016 US Elections</a> another. In decades past, you’d have needed the CIA or equivalent to have the same impact on democracy. Now it’s whomever can best manipulate the data we so willingly put online.</p>

<p>Its important to remember that this is happening in an age where the way we identify with technology is different. Back in the early 90s, a computer was something you used in an office. Who made it, or the software that ran on it, was of little concern to the day-to-day user.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Microsoft Windows holds nearly <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/218089/global-market-share-of-windows-7/">75% market share</a> on desktop computers, has done so for 30 years, and shows very little sign of slowing its roll. In fact, you have to widen the net to include phones in order to make the game at all interesting. In 2017 Google’s Android operating system became the first platform to <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share#yearly-2009-2023">overtake Windows</a> since 1993.</p>

<p>But the thing is, no one really <em>talks</em> about Operating Systems in day-to-day life, do they? Sure, computers feel pretty essential to most people in the Western World. And they are basically the basis of how modern people interact with… well, anything. But now we carry around devices that made those 90s office computers look like children’s playthings. And the services we interact with have cult-like followings. We all know Zuckerberg’s name, so when you learn that Facebook played a part in perverting democracy, you have a very clear face to blame.</p>

<p>But let’s wind back a little. The idea of a cult following of specific technology - for people who aren’t nerds - didn’t become a thing until, I would say, 2007. What happened in 2007?</p>

<p>Well friends, that leads us on to reason the second…</p>

<h2 id="the-cult-of-the-tech-celebrity">The cult of the tech celebrity</h2>

<p>In 2007, Steve Jobs announced the first iPhone, and the way we interacted with technology changed forever.</p>

<p>Jobs had been around for decades, of course - almost as long as Gates in fact. And he had experienced - if not quite the same prosaic rise in wealth - certainly a comparable amount of fame in his circles. Apple Inc. paved the way for much of what we consider to be essential in modern computing, and its products have always had devoted fans - not least of course, the iPod.</p>

<p>But when the first iPhone launched, Jobs’ household name status cemented. Gates vs Jobs was a constant source of discussion for nerds. But in the real world, amongst normal people, Jobs was a man untouched by competition. He was, arguably, the world’s first tech celebrity since Edison.</p>

<p>Again, the timeline of events here is important to our discussion. As we know, by 2007 Gates was already extricating himself from the world of home and office tech. Jobs had the stage to himself, and would hold on to it right up until his death in 2011. And by that point, Zuckerberg was in prime position to accept the crown.</p>

<p>Now, I’m being needlessly Shakespearean about the whole thing. But let’s paint that scene out a little more. By 2011 Facebook had over <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/facebook-has-over-845-million-users/">800 million users</a>. David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin’s film <em>The Social Network</em> had been out for a year. Zuckerberg himself was worth $13.5 billion.</p>

<p>People are talking about him, is my point.</p>

<p>But Zuckerberg wasn’t the only one. If Jobs opened the door for tech celebrities, Zuckerberg took a tank and drove it right through the side of the building (that metaphor probably needs a little work). He took pages from Job’s playbook and made them work for him - right down to the personal branding of his “uniform” (turtleneck and jeans for Jobs, non-descript T-shirt and jeans for Zuckerberg). And in his wake, we’ve had more and more people step up and become household, tech-driven, uber-nerds. Two in particular spring to mind immediately. Jeff Bezos went from a guy posting books through your letterbox to spending his wealth on a personal tour of the upper atmosphere alongside the Captain of the <em>Enterprise</em>. Elon Musk hardly needs an introduction, moving from (amongst others) PayPal to Tesla to SpaceX to Twitter.</p>

<p>What these three - Zuckerberg, Bezos, and Musk - all have in common is that they understand just how valuable data about individuals is. They are all, to varying degrees of success, developing ways to monetise that.</p>

<pullquote>If the service is free, you’re the product.</pullquote>

<h2 id="the-stakes-are-much-higher">The stakes are much higher</h2>

<p>And as the way we use tech continues to develop, and the more we let these services control how we run our lives, the tighter hold this cult of the tech celebrity has on us. Musk is an interesting addition to the list, because while people had heard of him, and the success of Tesla made the company a household name, as an individual he didn’t really make the mainstream until he bought Twitter. Or, to put it another way, his celebrity status wasn’t locked in until he bought one of the things that is almost ubiquitous to modern life.</p>

<p>Facebook, Twitter, and Amazon are things that people use every single day (well, maybe check back on Twitter) - if not in their “pure form” then via one of their other platforms or acquisitions - watching <em>Reacher</em> on Amazon Prime, or scrolling through Instagram reels on the commute to work, for example. Their CEOs are right in the centre of the Venn diagram of “products we use all the time” and “someone who is vocal and present enough to stay in my consciousness”.</p>

<p>So when they do something that we deem inappropriate, not only is our outrage more prominent, but it is proliferated more widely - ironically because of the very platforms they run. Gates is not short of controversy - relatively recently he confirmed an <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22441627/bill-gates-scandal-divorce-epstein">affair with a Microsoft employee</a> back in 2000, prompting a number of others to come forward with claims of similar behaviour from him throughout the 90s. His connection to Jeffery Epstein is also not a secret.</p>

<p>But Gates is no longer in the public eye in the same way. And even if he were still helming Microsoft, I suspect he wouldn’t be as vilified as the likes of Zuckerberg. When Facebook gets hacked and over <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/28/23481786/meta-fine-facebook-data-leak-ireland-dpc-gdpr">533 million of its users</a> had data leaked, it’s a gut punch to us because that’s our <em>personal</em> data. But when <a href="https://cybernews.com/news/stolen-data-of-500-million-linkedin-users-being-sold-online-2-million-leaked-as-proof-2/">500 million LinkedIn users’</a> data was scraped and sold we’re less bothered. Is that because, technically, that data is publicly accessible anyway? Sure, that is part of it. But I suspect it also has to do with our disassociation of platforms like LinkedIn with our “personal” selves. Of course, its all our personal data. But the way we give so much of personal lives to Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, suggests a deeper level of assumed trust. Having such a public figure - a literal figurehead - for that company makes it easier to be angry. It gives a face to the failure. And, of course, <em>The Social Network</em> showed us what kind of person he is to us, which makes it easier to dislike him in times where we’re wronged.</p>

<h2 id="the-reach-is-much-wider">The reach is much wider</h2>

<p>This is already a ludicrously long post, but I do want to address one more thing before I wrap up. I’ve touched on the breadth of these companies already, but I want to highlight just how vast they are, focusing on a minute on Amazon.</p>

<p>Through its Web Services, Amazon hosts around <a href="https://kinsta.com/aws-market-share/">one-third</a> of all websites on the internet. It’s responsible for hosting not just its own Amazon Prime service, but much of the requirements of Netflix and BBC iPlayer. It also, incidentally, provides compute power for a lot of Facebook services. Stepping away from it’s web hosting, Prime Video this year overtook Netflix as the most <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/496011/usa-svod-to-tv-streaming-usage/">popular streaming service in the US</a>, and Amazon Studios (it’s film production arm) while still arguably finding its feet on the scene, nevertheless plays an increasingly important role in cinema. Let’s not forget where it all started, with Amazon leading the way in e-commerce market share at nearly <a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/amazon-statistics/">40% of the US market</a>, and over 30% of the UK market. 2 out of every 10 books sold in the the US and Europe are <strong><em>not</em></strong> sold by Amazon.</p>

<p>Microsoft may well have a lock on what Operating System we use on our computers, and Bill Gates made sure that happened. But companies like Facebook and Amazon are a part of almost every single aspect of our lives. And Zuckerberg, Bezos, and co are all still very much key players in the day-to-day strategy. We used to think about technology in a completely different way, and we hold those people - who put themselves willingly into the limelight - to a very different standard.</p>

<p>We are more aware, more demanding, and more discerning about what we give and what we take from these companies.</p>

<p>So, in a sentence: Why does Bill Gates get a pass when Mark Zuckerberg gets slated? I think its because the stakes for us are so much higher, the rewards for them are so much greater.</p>
