                <div class="wrc-question">Answering the question: Does internet access change the way we think?</div>
            
            
            <p>It’s not exactly a secret that we live in a world that relies heavily on technology. From an increasing need to own a smartphone to do any kind of existing in 21st Century life, to the modern convenience of online shopping, there are few things that we do that don’t rely on tech.</p>

<p>One of these tech-free solaces, you might think, is the simple act of going for a walk. But for many of us (myself included) tech is snaking it’s tendrils into that as well. I wear a Fitbit pretty much constantly, and so when I take the dog for a walk in the morning, I know exactly how many steps I’ve done, and what distance I’ve travelled. As a UK-raised millennial, despite the obvious benefits of the metric system, I’m still conditioned to think about distances in miles. But when asked how far I’ve walked in a day, I feel like I should answer in kilometers. It’s 2023 and I really should have fully embraced metric by now (as I was saying to my 5’11” friend over a couple of pints the other day).</p>

<p>Here’s the thing though: gun to my head, I could not tell you how many miles go into a kilometer. Or is it kilometers into a mile? I genuinely don’t have that information in my brain. I’ve looked it up, countless times. But I just seem incapable of retaining that information. I think there’s a 7 involved?</p>

<p>The reason is that I know I can just ask my phone to do it. “Hey Google - what’s 5 miles in kilometers?” Ah - it’s 8.4km. Great stuff. I immediately no longer need that information.</p>

<p>I’m not alone in this. A <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1207745">2011 Science paper</a> showed that the advent of search engines has genuinely affected the way our brains function. To lift from a summary of the paper by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2011/07/study-why-bother-to-remember-when-you-can-just-use-google/">Ars Technica</a>, in general people who regularly use the internet are weaker at recalling information, and instead remember where they can go to retrieve that information.</p>

<h2 id="is-this-a-bad-thing">Is this a bad thing?</h2>

<p>I think it depends on your point of view. It’s probably not great that I have such a heavy reliance on my phone’s calendar (for example), but the research suggests that what this means is that our brains are becoming more efficient at processing information. From a bio-chemistry point of view, this shift means our brains have increased activity in the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in decision-making and “working memory” (as opposed to long-term memory). Any job that requires problem solving, decision-making, or the learning and application of complex concepts benefits from a strong prefrontal cortex.</p>

<p>The theory is that the more of this kind of thing I outsource, the more brain space I have for creative work. So far though, I’m yet to paint a Louvre-worthy masterpiece. That said, I do see it in other ways - for example when I code. I’m very rarely able to just open up an IDE and bash out dozens of lines off the top of my head. It involves a lot of Googling and referencing manuals - so much so that I’d worry I was a fraud, were it not such a common trope among developers. The skill in coding is not about memorising what every function does. It’s about understanding what is possible with any given language, and determining the best route to your answer.</p>

<h2 id="great-so-its-all-sunshine-and-rainbows">Great, so its all sunshine and rainbows?</h2>

<p>There are a number of skills that we’re slowly losing because we believe we can rely on technology to fill its place. One example is map-reading. You can argue whether this is really a loss, or it’s an evolution, but the fact is that people regularly <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mountain-hiker-gets-lost-22-29294659">get lost on hikes</a> because they either don’t take with them, or don’t know how to read, paper maps. Phones make for a decent guide in cities, are basically as good as high-end satnavs, but can become next to useless on hikes for any number of reasons including: battery dying, GPS signal not being accurate enough, no internet connection, or the temperature being so low that the phone doesn’t recognise your finger.</p>

<p>There is also a potential whole separate post to discuss what technology does to attention spans. Including the idea that one of the reasons long-term memory is taking a hit is because we aren’t holding information in our short-term memory long enough for it to make the jump (A-level Psychology coming in clutch here…).</p>

<p>There are other things that require strong long-term memory. Professions like Law, Medicine, and Academia require the recall of large amounts of often complex information. In many cases, simply being able to know exactly what to Google isn’t going to cut it.</p>

<h2 id="so-i-should-throw-out-my-smartphone">So I should throw out my smartphone?</h2>

<p>Well, no, melodramatic hypothetical reader, keep it around. For starters, you have the world’s knowledge at your fingertips, from the largest encyclopedia ever created, to humble one-man tech-focused blogs.</p>

<p>But I do think it’s important to understand how a reliance on technology can change the way you perceive and interact with the world around you. For me, it comes out in a number of other ways - for example I <strong><em>need</em></strong> events and appointments to be in my calendar, or they simply don’t exist to me. I’ve become a pretty good project manager in my career, but I rely on a robust system of time-blocking and to-do lists to function. None of this is bad, but if I didn’t acknowledge it and adapt my behaviour accordingly, it could have quite the negative impact on my life.</p>

<p>Learn how your dependence on technology is affecting you, I guess is my point.</p>

<p>I’m probably still not going to remember how many miles are in a kilometer though…</p>
