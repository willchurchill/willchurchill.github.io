            <p><strong><em>It’s difficult to get me to shut-up about new tech, so to help channel that excitement I’ve asked people to give me specific tech questions they have. In this post, my friend Chris - drummer for the band <a href="https://linktr.ee/scrapband">scrap</a> - wanted to know whether the rise in AI could be a good thing or a bad thing for songwriters.</em></strong></p>

<p>Since the public launch of ChatGPT 6 months ago (yup, it really was only 6 months ago), it seems there’s nothing that “AI” can’t help us with. From <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/05/02/chatgpt-ai-meal-planning-diet/">creating diet plans</a> to <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/i-had-chatgpt-write-my-college-essay-and-now-im-ready-to-go-back-to-school-and-do-nothing">writing college essays</a>, and even <a href="https://www.explainthis.io/en/chatgpt/interview">helping with interview prep</a>, no realm is safe from computer incursion. And that’s just in the world of text-based responses. Platforms like Dall-E and others can use prompts to create images, and some have even started using AI to <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/screening-room/an-ai-generated-film-depicts-human-loneliness-in-thank-you-for-not-answering">create films</a>.</p>

<p>Not even coders themselves are without competition. ChatGPT has even been used to create <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-asked-chatgpt-to-write-a-wordpress-plugin-i-needed-it-did-it-in-less-than-5-minutes/">basic WordPress plugins</a>, among other things.</p>

<p>But what about music? Can the latest in “AI” technology make a dent in the music business. Specifically, how can AI help or hinder songwriting?</p>

<h2 id="what-is-ai-or-more-specifically-what-is-chatgpt">What is AI? Or more specifically, what is ChatGPT?</h2>

<p>First, let’s take a look at what we mean by “AI”. While much song and dance was made about ChatGPT when it first hit the mainstream, it’s quickly become apparent that we’re still a few steps away from Skynet. There are plenty of super in-depth articles about the specifics of what we’ve come to call “AI”, but for our purposes the thing to understand is that, when you ask ChatGPT a question it’s primary aim is to give you an answer that sounds like a human being responded.</p>

<p>One of the downsides of this is that it’s actually not great at giving accurate answers. For example, I asked ChatGPT a few weeks ago to write me a short biography.</p>

<p><img src="https://willrc.co.uk/assets/images/articles/ai-songwriting/chatgpt-who-is-willrc.png" alt="Screenshot of me asking ChatGPT to write me a bio. It produced a very eloquent, but inaccurate, response. Response included a statement that I had worked for the Prince's Trust." /></p>

<p>A very clear and eloquent answer immediately presented itself. The only problem? Almost none of that is true. Even more worrying, when you try to query the answer itself, ChatGPT falls down a rabbit hole of gaslighting:</p>

<p><img src="https://willrc.co.uk/assets/images/articles/ai-songwriting/chatgpt-princes-trust-question.png" alt="Screenshot of me asking ChatGPT why it thought I worked at the Prince's Trust. It replied that it made no such claim." /></p>

<p>I have never worked at the Prince’s Trust, but I have mentored young people. It says as much in my LinkedIn profile, and so when ChatGPT found the words “mentoring” and “young people”, it’s predictive nature kicked in. You know what happens when you Google “mentoring young people”?</p>

<p><img src="https://willrc.co.uk/assets/images/articles/ai-songwriting/google-search-mentoring-young-people.png" alt="Google Search for &quot;mentoring young people&quot; where the top result is for The Prince's Trust." /></p>

<p>So all ChatGPT has done is tried to fill in gaps by predicting what the next part of the sentence should be, all with the lens of making sure that whatever the response is, it sounds like a real sentence.</p>

<h2 id="ok-so-chatgpt-might-not-always-be-accurate-but-does-that-matter-for-songwriting">Ok, so ChatGPT might not always be accurate, but does that matter for songwriting?</h2>

<p>While we know that ChatGPT isn’t the go-to for fact-checking, what we have learned is that it is great at putting words together in specific ways.</p>

<p>Structure, in fact, is one of the things ChatGPT is best at. So with the right parameters, it is a very powerful tool in a lot of ways. It’s great at organising data, and also understands how to put information into specific form factors. Let’s see what happens if we ask ChatGPT to write us a little ditty.</p>

<p><img src="https://willrc.co.uk/assets/images/articles/ai-songwriting/chatgpt-haiku-01.png" alt="Screenshot of a haiku generated by ChatGPT." /></p>

<p>Not great, perhaps. But not too bad as far as 5 seconds of work goes. Here is where it gets interesting though - one thing that sets apart ChatGPT from its predecessors is the ability for you to hold a dialogue with the platform. If you liked a particular part of this haiku, you can ask the bot to emphasis it in further iterations.</p>

<p><img src="https://willrc.co.uk/assets/images/articles/ai-songwriting/chatgpt-haiku-02.png" alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT revising the haiku based on feedback." /></p>

<p>And let’s go for one more revision.</p>

<p><img src="https://willrc.co.uk/assets/images/articles/ai-songwriting/chatgpt-haiku-03.png" alt="Screenshot of a further revision to the haiku based on further feedback." /></p>

<p>You get the idea. We’re probably not going to win any awards here. But the point is that you can go back and forth and make adjustments without having to do much actual thinking. Here I’ve used a haiku to keep it simple, but the software doesn’t care what type of song you want.</p>

<p><img src="https://willrc.co.uk/assets/images/articles/ai-songwriting/chatgpt-country-song.png" alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT creating a country and and western song about using ChatGPT to create music." /></p>

<p>You can even rip off existing songs, and rework them for your own purposes, if you’re so inclined. (And yes, I most definitely threw in a typo on purpose to demonstrate that the mighty ChatGPT can see through that…)</p>

<p><img src="https://willrc.co.uk/assets/images/articles/ai-songwriting/chatgpt-piano-man.png" alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT rewriting Billy Joel's &quot;Piano Man&quot;, but to be about ChatGPT." /></p>

<h2 id="looks-like-theres-nothing-it-cant-do-whats-the-downside">Looks like there’s nothing it can’t do. What’s the downside?</h2>

<p>There’s a couple of things to be aware of here. The first you’ve probably already spotted. It’s not very good. Now, you can fix that (to a point) with some back and forth, and a lot of tweaking and rewording of what you’re asking the system to do. The more you do that, perhaps the closer to a workable song you’ll get. If that’s the road you want to take though, at a certain point you’ve got to question how much time do you want to spend on guiding the AI vs doing your own thinking.</p>

<p>There is perhaps a wider concern though. While it is admittedly an over-simplification to keep referring to ChatGPT as a predictive text generator (and I’d definitely have made some very clever people angry if they read that), it is important to remember that AI-models are based on existing data. Vast amounts of it, to be sure, but finite amounts nonetheless. Beyond a certain point, everything that an AI like ChatGPT produces is a derivation of existing content. Of course, there are those that argue that all art is thus. We only have a finite number of words in the dictionary, after all. So how can you do anything in art without it being derivative. And while we’re staring down that train of thought, what’s the line between derivative and homage? Why is Andy Warhol considered an artist? What about Weird Al?</p>

<h2 id="so-is-that-a-yay-or-nay-for-ai-as-a-songwriting-tool">So is that a yay or nay for AI as a songwriting tool?</h2>

<p>I’m not a musician, but it strikes me that, as with a lot of technology, the answer to that question depends on how you use it.</p>

<p>ChatGPT has proven itself to be good at generating structure. It’s also got a keen virtual ear for rhyme and a reasonable one for meter. And, of course, it has access to basically every lyric in recorded history (<a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6783457-what-is-chatgpt">pre 2021</a>). It can very much write you a song.</p>

<p>Indeed it has - and I don’t mean country music of dubious quality. A few months ago, a new collaboration between The Weeknd and Drake - <em>Heart On My Sleeve</em> - <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/19/arts/music/ai-drake-the-weeknd-fake.html">went viral across</a> social media. Only, it wasn’t a collab at all. Various AI tools had been used - including a ChatGPT-esque platform to create the lyrics - in order to put together a song that sounded like a genuine article. While super fans might have been able to tell something was up, for most <em>Heart On My Sleeve</em> was a very passable track that could have been the real deal. From a lyrics point of view, AI was able to analyse existing tracks from both artists, and put together words that were in keeping with their style.</p>

<p>So perhaps it comes down to what you want. Ghostwriting in music has been around for about as long as we’ve had music. If you’re the kind of artist that uses a ghostwriter, should it make a difference to you whether the words you sing come from a human or a machine? If the quality is the same, would you even notice?</p>

<p>Or maybe you can use it as a “first draft” - a little kickstart for your inspiration before you build and make it your own.</p>

<p>Either way, one of the most important aspects is the prompt you give it. Just like our haiku example above, we can tweak and refine the output by iterating the prompt.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that, while I’ve focused here on ChatGPT (largely because it’s the most well known of the AI chatbots), it is not the only player in the space. ChatGPT has been specifically designed for a certain type of output - human-style conversation. But other services have been developed for more niche uses. While I’m not aware of any that have been designed especially for songwriting at the moment, the technology to do that does exist.</p>

<h2 id="but-its-not-just-about-creating-the-content">But it’s not just about creating the content…</h2>

<p>Despite the plethora of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-launches-boom-ai-written-e-books-amazon-2023-02-21/">self-published AI-generated sci-fi</a> books flooding Amazon, I don’t think Neal Stephenson is losing out on sales. And on the flipside, there are many people who are making money now who weren’t before. Could this be one of those times where technology actually acts as a leveller of the field? Is it fair to say that more people are getting a bite of the cherry, without damaging the livelihoods of those already eating?</p>

<p>I’m not a musician, but I do have some experience with creating and marketing content. It strikes me that the creation of content is so rarely the problem. If anything, AI-assistance here may well help those who struggle in that area, but it isn’t going to be a game-changer to those already producing content. The problem most people face is in getting people to consume what they produce. <em>Heart On My Sleeve</em> didn’t go viral because it was an incredible song. It went viral because people thought they were listening to The Weeknd and Drake, and then stayed viral because of the novelty that they actually weren’t.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>

<p>So to return to our question, will AI help or hinder songwriters? I think it has the power to do both. But, on balance, I think if used in the right way it could help. That is, after all, the point of technology. We just need to work out how best to use it.</p>

<p>The common theme throughout the examples we’ve looked at here is iteration. I don’t think we’re in danger of the music scene being overwhelmed with AI-generated music that puts songwriters out of business. I think that for largely the same reasons that I’m relatively sure my work as a developer is not going to be put in huge danger. AI can only take you so far. You need to understand what you’re putting into the system, and you need to be able to work with what that system spits out. Some of the grunt work can be done by the machines, but you still need someone at either end of the process who understands the fundamentals of the craft.</p>

<p>I’m a technology optimist. I’m not naïve to the concerns people have around AI, but as a tool to help us be better, I definitely think there’s a lot of exciting things happening.</p>
