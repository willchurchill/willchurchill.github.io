For a long while last night, I read through all the things that I’ve highlighted on Medium.</p>

<div class="quote-container"><div class="quotemarks-open">&#8220;</div><div class="quotetext"><p>Most of what makes a book 'good' is that we're reading it at the right moment for us.</p><p>-- <a href="https://twitter.com/alaindebotton/status/379476642143686656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Alain de Botton (@alaindebotton) [September 16, 2013]</a></p></div><div class="quotemarks-close">&#8221;</div></div>

<p>I read a lot of blogs, and on Medium, when something particularly resonates with me at that point in time, I highlight it. As I was reading through my highlights, I realised a) that there were <em>a lot</em> of them, but that meant that b) there are a lot of people out there who — at least sometimes — think the way that I sometimes think.</p>

<p>Every once in a while, we all need a reminder that, with 7 billion people on the planet, a few of your interpretations of the world are going to be shared by others. So, in that spirit, I wanted to share some of the most poignant things I’ve read here.</p>

<p>It was difficult deciding what quotes I would put — the most striking quotes were often the most difficult to read and, despite the content, I didn’t want this to be an ‘overbearing’ post. Rather, if you’re going through a darker patch, a reminder that you’re probably not as alone as your psyche makes you think. In any case, full credit — and a great deal of thanks — goes to every single person I’ve quoted, and a great many more that I haven’t.</p>

  <p>I attempted to subdue those fears by working a lot. A lot. There were nights when I would ride my bike home at 9 p.m. or 10 p.m., only to open my laptop again and continue working after I got home. I spent time over weekends logged in making sure our help desk was empty or in the office trying to finish the project I hoped would make me feel secure there. I would kill my alarm and open my email with one swift motion each morning. I still couldn’t really explain what I was doing. </p>

  <p>So we become editors of ourselves, preservationists of our suffering. We become architects of our masks; we reframe our true stories in work and in life.

  <p>Which means that if you met me or talked to me for a few minutes, you wouldn’t know. And sometimes it feels like a secret. A secret that I’m ashamed to be carrying around with me. Because as hard as we’re working to break down the stigma surrounding mental illness, it still exists. And as much as we’re talking about depression and finding out that all different kinds of people are struggling, it still seems like there’s a certain way I’m supposed to appear. </p>

  <p>The problem with faking it is that you miss out on the opportunity to be helped and to help others. Maybe you’re struggling financially and the person you’re chatting with has a job at her company that would be perfect for you, but since she thinks you’re “crushing it” the topic will never come up. Maybe the person you are talking to is going through the same thing, and if they just knew they had a friend in it, they wouldn’t feel so alone. </p>

<h3 id="and-on-speakingout">…and on speaking out</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Silence is the enemy, the oppressor, the killer, but how do we break its spell? As a veteran in this (depression, I mean), one problem I keep running into is getting lost in translation. Finding the courage to speak is hard enough, but even if you wanted to give voice to the gremlins of the mind, you might not know how to, or if you’d be understood at all. Language would very likely fail you. Language would obfuscate expression and obstruct connection. It would stuff depression into a nebulous catchall for anything and everything from mere blues and boredom to severe mental disorder, but it would leave out the real thing, the inexplicable, inexorable pain, the constant, fortuitous, textured, unfathomable dread that defies both lay parlance and doctor speak. </p>

  <p>This is a social contract we have all struck. And it’s one that we cosign, again and again, in every instance when we possibly could (because we won’t get fired from work or because we have to opportunity to tell a trusted person how we are actually doing) admit to not being ok, but say that we are ok. It’s something that I am guilty of and I am working on and in part, I wanted to invite you to work on it with me. I want to be able to say “you know what? Not great. But we don’t have to talk about it right now,” the next time I am not ok and someone asks how I am.

<h3 id="some-finalthoughts">Some final thoughts</h3>

<p>I love language, and the power of the written word. It continually amazes me how the combination of a mere 26 letters and some dots and lines can, in the right hands, invoke such profound imagery.</p>

<p>There aren’t that many subjects that illicit a lot of “I don’t know”s from me (I’m quite the know-it-all). Mental health though, is one of them. It’s a big and complicated thing, and more often than not I feel like I’m grasping for the right words to describe how I feel at any given moment.</p>

<p>So it comforts me, in a weird way, to know that — however I’m feeling, and whether or not I have the words to describe that — someone out there can so eloquently express what I’m going through. Often, it’s not even about having the words to make things better, or to pick me up. The solace comes from the fact that these thoughts and emotions aren’t so big that they can’t be described. These feelings might be bigger, deeper, more complex than <em>I</em> can articulate. But they aren’t so unfathomable that someone, somewhere, isn’t up to the challenge. Someone out there can put my thoughts — our thoughts — into words.</p>

<p>And, indeed, they probably already have.</p>
