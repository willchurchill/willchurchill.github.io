# Abstract #

There is little doubt that the political involvement of the general public has been a key concern of political thinking in recent times. Certain government actions, such as the establishment of the Modernisation Committee in 2005, point to a growing realisation that a greater sense of transparency is needed in the political system. In particular, young people (usually classified as 16-24 year olds) appear to be the focus of much of this attention. But is this enough? Now, more than ever, it seems important to understand how young people perceive Politics and what motivates them to get involved.

This dissertation will explore the idea that enthusiasm in Politics can be generated from a relatively early age. In particular, it will examine the hypothesis that an involvement in Politics in late teenage years – through post-16 education – can be directly linked to a later interest and involvement in Politics. It will explore this hypothesis using a mixture of secondary sources and primary research, with the latter taking the form of surveys, focus groups, and interviews.

This dissertation begins by looking at the general political involvement of British citizens. Documents such as the Hansard Society&#39;s _Audit of Political Engagement_, in particular, will be examined, along with the work of individuals such as Gerry Stoker and Colin Hay. Various forms of political involvement will also be addressed, ranging from simply voting in elections, to boycotting products and contacting MPs.

The focus will then be narrowed, and cases of political involvement by individuals will be considered. This will be facilitated through data from surveys and further secondary research, thus establishing correlation between post-16 education and an involvement in Politics.

This, however, will not be enough to establish causation. The next chapter will aim to address this using deeper qualitative data from focus groups and interviews. This will aim to definitively determine whether or not education is the dominant contributing factor in influencing an individual&#39;s political participation.

The dissertation will conclude by summarising the evidence found throughout the investigation and, should this evidence show the hypothesis to be correct, will advocate that education at a post-16 level be recommended to further the involvement and inclusion of the general public, and specifically young people, in political matters.

# Chapter 1: Introduction #

## What is &#39;political involvement&#39;? ##

The term &#39;political involvement&#39; is clearly a broad one. It can encompass a great many aspects of both political and even civic life. In addition to the obvious example of voting, Gerry Stoker cites &quot;signing petitions, boycotting certain products, or even going on a march to protest a war…&quot; as other examples of political activism (2006, p.89). Colin Hay lists 3 broad categories that acts of political engagement fall into, giving examples such as &quot;membership of political parties&quot;, engaging in &quot;informal and/or extra-parliamentary forms of political conduct&quot;, and even &quot;levels of trust and confidence in politicians and public officials&quot; (2007, p.12).

Clearly, then, there are many ways in which the engagement of an individual can be measured. For the purposes of this dissertation, a range of different measures will be used to assess an individual&#39;s level of involvement with Politics. These are explained in full in Chapter 4, but briefly include, amongst others: voting in elections, having a membership to a political party, and engaging with an MP regarding matters of interest.

## The need for political involvement in youth ##

The Hansard _Audit of Political Engagement_ is an annual document published by the Hansard Society cataloguing the public&#39;s level of involvement and satisfaction with various aspects of the UK government.

The _Audit of Political Engagement 8_ (hereafter referred to as &#39;_Audit_ 8&#39;) was published in 2011, and shows that public interest in Politics stood at the highest level ever recorded by _Audit 8_, at 58% (p3). However, it does note that the most affected age group is the 34 – 44 age bracket, with a 12 point rise compared with the previous year (from 49% interest in 2010 to 61% in 2011). The report postulates that the previous general election and its associated media coverage may have drawn interest from those who &quot;had perhaps the most to gain or lose from the results&quot; thus explaining the increase in interest of this demographic (p19). This follows the seemingly commonly-held view that Politics only caters to the &#39;middle-aged&#39; generation. As Chapter 5 of this paper examines in more detail, there is a sense – particularly among the younger generation – that politicians do very little to encourage the involvement of the 16 – 24 age group.

A 2009 report by the Youth Citizenship Commission further supports this, claiming that only 40% of young people (defined as 11 – 25 year olds in the study in question) felt they understood how decisions in government are made (p19). However, a quote from one participant of the study said:

> "If there were lessons in Citizenship based specifically on Politics, it would increase our understanding of it." (p19)

This quote, along with others in the report, highlights that there is a greater call for increased political education. What is less clear is whether the increase in understanding would lead to a higher level of participation.

Disenchantment in general is a growing problem, with _Audit 8_ showing that only 30% of respondents agreed the general public getting involved in Politics would lead to a change in the way the UK is run (2011, p.21). There are many schools of thought on trying to re-engage citizens across the globe. Andrew Glencross, for instance, writes about Estonia&#39;s &#39;TOM&#39; system of e-participation, a method of reform that &quot;representative democracies are currently experimenting with in the hope that participation counteracts public disillusionment&quot; (2007, p.2). Meanwhile Carty et al discusses British Columbia&#39;s Citizen&#39;s Assembly, which engaged its citizens directly on the issue of electoral reform (2008, p.143)

Both of these examples however focus on the act of voting as the premier act of participation. As Stoker, Hay, and others point out however, engagement encompasses more than just voting. Consequently, a more holistic approach to reviving engagement is needed.

# Chapter 2: The general level of political involvement in youth #

## Is there a cause for concern? ##

Another point of note drawn up by the _Audit of Political Engagement 8_ is that 45% of those who claim they are &quot;absolutely certain to vote&quot; in the next election know &quot;not very much&quot; or &quot;nothing at all&quot; about Parliament (2011, p20). This worryingly large number of people who plan to vote but by their own admission do not really know much about the political system, is a statistic that is supported by this dissertation; Chapter 4 examines the results of a questionnaire, while Chapter 5 looks at the results of focus groups and interviews. Both of these show evidence of individuals who are keen to vote, but knowingly have very little knowledge of Politics. While the figures from _Audit 8_ are from the population as a whole, anecdotal evidence (such as that presented in Chapter 5) suggests that if anything this figure would be higher for the younger demographic. Given that voting in an elections lies &quot;…at the heart of the liberal democratic conception of Politics,&quot; (Hay 2007, p.12) it is troubling that such a large portion of the population are apparently basing their most important democratic move on severely limited knowledge. At the very worst, it brings the legitimacy of our democracy into question.As Schumpeter writes &quot;…the role of the people is to produce a government…&quot; and, after the election of the government, the citizen&#39;s role ends and democracy has served its purpose (1942, p.257). This being true, it should surely be in the interest of the electorate that they be as well educated in political affairs as possible?

At present much of the research surrounding the issue of political knowledge and participation is focused on those who can already vote. There is however research being carried out that does focus on the younger demographic. In a paper entitled _Expansion of democracy by lowering the voting age_, the Parliamentary Assemblyrecognises that the political process is already dominated by issues of primary concern to the older generation, writing:

> "The demographic evolution in Europe could lead to the increasing marginalisation of young people in the political process, which risks being dominated by issues primarily of interest to older people. Such a development could endanger the stability of democracy at a time when social cohesion is more important than ever… Research indicated that the longer young people have to wait to participate in political life, the less engaged they are in adult life." (2011, p.2)

The report also points to lowering the voting age as a means of mitigating the disengagement of young people from the political system, disputing arguments that doing so would actually increase low turnout by citing a report by the think tank &#39;Demos&#39; showing that the expected portion of 16 and 17 year olds who &quot;would not vote&quot; was actually lower than those over 18 years of age (9% and 11% respectively) (_ibid_. pp.6-7).

Although both the Parliamentary Assembly report and the report by &#39;Demos&#39; (Reeves and Nadesan 2010) are focused on the question of lowering the voting age, not about whether or not to provide political education to lower ages, both questions are focused on youth engagement and thus the issue of voting at 16 is a closely related one.

All of the above evidence points to a dramatic need for change with our current system. Nearly a third of the UK&#39;s population is under the age of 25 (Office of National Statistics [online]), and a large portion of this demographic feels detached from the political process. It is not within the scope of this paper to discuss the issue of votes at 16, but regardless it seems clear that there is room for a greater involvement with the political system at a younger age. This paper will aim to assess in more detail the attitudes of the younger demographic, and determine whether or not a more in-depth post-16 political education is necessary, or even desirable.

# Chapter 3: Conducting a Pilot Survey #

## Methodology ##

In order to determine whether this would be a feasible study, a pilot survey was initially carried out. The aim of this survey was two-fold. Firstly, it intended to see if there was a correlation between the subjects studied at A-level and those studied at University, in order to show that early exposure to Politics is more conducive to a later interest. The second aim was to see turnout figures for both the last General Election and the 2011 Referendum on the voting system, and determine whether there was a higher turnout amongst Politics students compared with non-Politics students.

An internet survey was distributed consisting of 3 sections: Section 1 determined the age and occupation of the respondent, and if they were a student whether they studied Politics or not; Section 2 determined whether the respondent voted in the most recent General Election (held in 2010), whether they thought they would vote in the next one, and whether they voted in the 2011 AV Referendum; Section 3 determined media habits of the individual, specifically how often they read print news papers, and how often they read news from online sources. [^1]

## Findings ##

The survey found that, of those who had studied Politics at any point in their academic career 100% of them voted in the general election. This compares with only 66% turnout for those who had never studied Politics. With regards to the AV referendum, turnout amongst Politics students was 75%, and 50% for those who had not studied Politics.

![Figure - Pie Charts showing voter turnout for the 2010 General Elections for Non-Politics students (left) and Politics students (right)]({{site.url}}/assets/images/university/dis-fig1-2010-election-turnout-politics-nonpolitics.jpg)

While there were several limitations to the pilot study (for instance, the low number of respondents; only 20 people completed the survey), the results show a clear correlation between studying Politics, and political participation, with regards to voting. More importantly, the results highlighted the potential for a further investigation.

# Chapter 4: Political involvement in students (Questionnaire) #

## Assessing Involvement: Methodology ##

In order to assess the level of political involvement in the student body surveys were distributed among students. A combination of Opportunity and Quota Sampling was used in order to determine the required sample characteristics.

Quota sampling is a method were by a predetermined set of characteristics are defined, and then a desired number for each of those categories is established (Burnham _et al_ 2008, pp.106-7). For instance, in the case of this paper, it was known that a minimum of 100 people were required to take the survey, and that at least 40% of them should be people who had studied Politics, and that at least 40% should be people who had not. The remaining 20% could be from either category.

The survey was then distributed online (through email and social media) and results were collated. In instances where more respondents of one group than the other were obtained, the &#39;extra&#39; amount of people was calculated, and then the appropriate number of respondents was discounted from the results. In order that this not negatively bias individuals who responded later than others, each respondent was given a number and a random number generator was used to select those individuals who would be discounted from the result. [^2]

Online surveys were used, rather than paper form ones, because they are cheaper and easier to send out to a wider geographic area. This enabled a large sample size to be obtained with relative ease, resulting in a large data set to analyse and from which to draw conclusions. It also allowed the collection of data from not only University of Southampton students, but also students from other parts of the country, lending greater support to the findings of the research.

Another advantage to using the internet to distribute the questionnaire is that it circumvents certain biases that might have occurred through face-to-face distribution. One example is interviewer bias, but perhaps more pertinent to this research is the potential of over and under representation of certain social groups. For instance, were the survey to be distributed by hand during the day at a local shopping centre, then there would be an underrepresentation of full-time workers (Burnham _et al_ 2008, p.107). Given that the paper is primarily concerned with data collection from students, this might not be overly problematic. Instead of a local shopping centre, the Student&#39;s Union could be used as a distribution point, for example. However, even on a campus location, there would most likely be a misrepresentation of certain groups of students. This is something that should be considered in potential future research.

The use of online surveys did mean that only those with an internet connection were part of the sample population, which does of course have disadvantages as a sampling method; those with access to the internet tend not to be representative of the whole population, and are on the younger and/or wealthier ends of the spectrum (Office of National Statistics 2010). There are several mitigating factors with regard to this research however. Firstly, Whiteley showed that as the number of people with an internet connection rises, the lesser the effect of the sampling bias (2009, p.2). In addition, as the main focus of the research is on university students, it can be assumed that the sample population is already on the younger end of the spectrum. Furthermore, because it is assumed that all university students have access to an internet connection, this negates the sampling bias in this case.

The survey consisted of 6 sections: Section 1 collected demographic data; Section 2 determined educational and employment traits; Section 3 ascertained the level of political involvement undertaken by the individual; Section 4 was a short quiz on various political facts; Section 5 determined the amount and the type of media consumed; whilst Section 6 determined any extra-curricular involvements. [^3]

A selection of the questions in Section 4 were modelled on research carried out by a paper written by Denver and Hands (1990, pp.265-267). Their work _Does Studying Politics Make a Difference_ included questions designed to test respondents&#39; level of political literacy. Denver and Hands&#39; study makes for an interesting comparison with this research, as their findings show a clear difference between those who studied Politics, and those who did not. As they write:

> &quot;An overall indicator of the level of political knowledge of our respondents may be obtained by summing the number of correct answers to all thirty-one of questions so far considered… The maximum possible score of 31 was achieved by 135 Politics students but by only ten non-Politics students.&quot; (_ibid_., p.267)

The similarities between the research by Denver and Hands, and the work of this paper, create some interesting opportunities for comparison. These are explored at the end of Chapter 4 of this dissertation.

While the survey, and the bulk of this research, is aimed primarily at the student population, non-students were also permitted to take the survey, in order to collect as complete a sample as possible. The past qualifications of any non-students were recorded, so that their responses could also be categorised as &#39;Political&#39; or &#39;non-Political&#39; individuals.

In order to assess the correlations of certain aspects of behaviour (for example the supposed knowledge of an individual and whether or not this a) was a result of political education, and b) would result in higher political engagement), a &#39;score&#39; was given across various sections of the questionnaire. For instance, Question 3.3 (&quot;Did you vote in the last General Election (2010)?&quot;) was a &#39;Yes/No&#39; answer. When coding these responses, Boolean logic was applied, with &#39;Yes&#39; assigned a value of &#39;1&#39;, and &#39;No&#39; given a value of &#39;0&#39;. The same was done for a variety of questions with &#39;Yes/No&#39; responses. Where there was an &#39;unsure&#39; option, the value 0.5 was assigned. [^4]

The questions and relevant responses were then grouped into one of 5 categories, as illustrated in the table below.

| **Category** | **Questions** |
| --- | --- |
| **Interest** | 3.1 |
| **Participation** | 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 |
| **Knowledge** | All of section 4 |
| **Media / News** | All of section 5 |

<br><small>Table - Breakdown of Question Results assigned to each score</small>

By assigning all of the answers a Boolean value, it allows the &#39;sum&#39; of the answers to be calculated, and an &#39;overall score&#39; generated for each category. For instance, for the &#39;actual involvement&#39; category, one participant is a member of a political party, has voted in both the General Election and the Local Election, but not their Student Union Election, in addition, they have never boycotted a product, nor spoken to their MP. Taking all these factors into account, this participant has a &#39;Participation&#39; score of 3 (1 for each: being a member of a political party, voting in the General Election, voting in the Local Election; 0 for each: voting in the student union election, boycotting a product, and speaking to MP).

This system allows each of the &#39;scores&#39; for each of the categories to be assessed against each other to determine correlations. This means that &#39;knowledge&#39;, for instance, can be measured against &#39;Participation&#39; in order to determine whether knowing about Politics and being engaged are linked.

## General findings ##

A total of 120 participants answered the survey, with a fairly even split between Politics and non-Politics respondents (56 and 64 respectively). There was a slightly higher proportion of males who took the survey compared with females (54% to 46% respectively), and over half of the respondents (68%) claimed to have a moderate to high interest in Politics, scoring themselves a 4 or 5 on Question 3.1 (&quot;On a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being &#39;Not at all interested&#39; and 5 being &#39;Very interested&#39;) how interested in Politics/political affairs would you consider yourself?&quot;).

![Figure - Pie Chart showing the Male to Female split between questionnaire respondents]({{site.url}}/assets/images/university/dis-fig2-gender-split.png)
<br><small>Figure - Pie Chart showing the Male to Female split between questionnaire respondents</small>

10 of the respondents (making up 8% of the sample) scored themselves &#39;2&#39; or lower on Question 3.1, indicating that they have a limited interest in Politics. Of those, 70% still voted in the General Elections, and all but 3 of these participants plan to vote in the next General Elections (one participant of the 10 stated they were still unsure). These findings concur with those of the Hansard _Audit of Political Engagement 8_, which found that a large portion of people &quot;absolutely certain&quot; to vote in the next General Election felt they did not know a lot about Parliament (2010, p.5). While the percentages differ in the findings of this paper, this dissertation&#39;s sample population is predominantly made up of university students, who tend to be better educated. Because of this, and the fact that _Audit 8_ questions a cross-section of the whole population, it should be expected that the latter would have a higher percentage of respondents with a lower knowledge of political affairs.

It should be noted that there are some key differences between _Audit 8_ and this questionnaire. For instance this questionnaire asked about interest in Politics, contrasting with _Audit 8_ which asked about perceived knowledge. Thus any inferences made regarding the comparison between this paper and the above listed findings of _Audit 8_ is merely conjecture. In order to account for this, Section 5 of the questionnaire was designed to test participants&#39; knowledge on a small range of political issues. The knowledge scores of the 10 participants who scored a &#39;2&#39; or lower on Q3.1 were wide-ranging. The mean score across all participants was 8.8. 3 of the 10 participants scored over, with one scoring 13 out of a possible 16. The lowest score of the 10 participants was 6 – still higher than the lowest over-all score of 4. This meant that we could measure participants&#39; knowledge against their likelihood to vote, and present a clearer contrast between these findings, and those of _Audit 8_.

## Interest in Politics vs Knowledge of Political Affairs ##

**Methodology**

Question 3.3 of the survey asked participants:

> &quot;On a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being &#39;Not at all interested&#39; and 5 being &#39;Very interested&#39;) how interested in Politics/political affairs would you consider yourself?&quot;

Participants were then given a Likert scale of 1 to 5 from which to select an answer. The purpose of this was to set a self-assessed benchmark, so that other aspects of the questionnaire could be compared with the individual&#39;s self-quantified political interest.

Section 4 of the survey was designed to simply assess the knowledge of the participants with reference to various political affairs. The first question block asked the participants to name the individuals occupying various government posts, the second question block asked participants to chose 3 of a possible 7 traits that a democracy possesses, and the third question block asked participants to answer 5 &#39;True or False&#39; statements. [^5]

The answers were then scored. In the case of Section 4 correct answers were given a score of 1, and incorrect answers (including answers that were left blank) were given a score of 0. The scores from the 3 sections were then added together and a percentage was taken showing the number of correct answers. This was then compared against the figure from the Likert scale to assess any correlation.

**Findings**

![Figure - Graph of Participants&#39; Interest in Politics against their Political Knowledge Scores]({{site.url}}/assets/images/university/dis-fig3-interest-vs-knowledge.png)
<br><small>Figure - Graph of Participants&#39; Interest in Politics against their Political Knowledge Scores</small>


Figure 3 shows a graph plotting the results of the analysis. By calculating Spearman&#39;s Rank Correlation Co-efficient, and obtaining a figure of 0.379, it shows a positive correlation between the two variables. [^6]

 Although the figure is not high enough to be statistically significant, it is still a positive number, and therefore nevertheless represents an important finding. The results show a good benchmark for the participants&#39; self-awareness of their political interest. Towards the end of this chapter, the difference in responses between Politics and non-Politics students is examined in more detail.

In addition, given the correlation between knowledge and self-assessed interest, it is also possible to extrapolate that those with a lower interest in Politics are less knowledgeable, thus supporting the results of the _Audit of Political Engagement 8_ with regards to individuals who wish to vote but are not well-versed in political affairs. Care must be taken however, to not assume that those who wish to vote do not have a high level of political knowledge.

## Political Knowledge vs Political Participation ##

**Methodology**

Aside from Q3.1, the remainder of Section 3 of the questionnaire was designed to assess the respondent&#39;s level of political involvement. Once again the responses were assigned Boolean values, and the sum of these values was taken as a percentage of the total possible options. [^7]

These two percentages were then placed in a graph. The findings are written below.

**Findings**

![Figure - Graph showing Participants&#39; Political Knowledge against their Political Involvement Score]({{site.url}}/assets/images/university/dis-fig4-knowledge-vs-involvement.png)
<br><small>Figure - Graph showing Participants&#39; Political Knowledge against their Political Involvement Score</small>


Figure 2 shows the relationship between an individual&#39;s political knowledge, and their level of political participation. The results are quite surprising. Calculating Spearman&#39;s Rank Correlation Co-efficient gives a value of 0.031 – while this is a positive correlation, it is an incredibly weak one. This suggests that knowledge of political affairs is not related to an individual&#39;s political participation.

This is an important finding, as the implication is that post-16 education – the most obvious method of imparting political knowledge to young people – may not have the desired effect. This is corroborated by other research, for example Kam and Palmer who argue that &quot;higher education is a proxy for preadult experiences and influences, not a cause of political participation&quot; (2008, p.612). In other words, while political education may be a helping factor in determining participation – possibly even necessary – it is not sufficient. The weak nature of the correlation shows this, though in the case of this graph the Politics and non-Politics students have not been separated. At the end of this chapter the differences between those who have formally studied Politics and those who have not will be examined.

## Political Knowledge vs News Score ##

**Methodology**

Section 5 of the questionnaire assessed the respondent&#39;s exposure to various media outlets; these included news channels, print newspapers, and online news. The participants were asked to state the number of hours a week they spent watching TV (and of that how many hours watching news channels), how often they read print newspapers, and how often they visited news websites. For the latter two questions, a 5 point Likert scale was offered ranging from &#39;Never&#39; through to &#39;Daily (every weekday)&#39;. These responses were then assigned a number (from 0 to 5 inclusive), and converted into a percentage (using 5 for every answer as the maximum possible value).

This allowed comparison with the &#39;Knowledge Score&#39; to assess correlation between the two variables.

**Findings**

Figure 5 shows the results of the analysis. The trend line appears to show a positive correlation between the amount of exposure to news outlets, and the level of political knowledge possessed by an individual. Calculating Spearman&#39;s Rank Correlation Co-efficient gives a value of 0.390 – again proving a positive correlation.

![Figure - Graph showing Participants&#39; Political Knowledge against their exposure to News outlets]({{site.url}}/assets/images/university/dis-fig5-knowledge-vs-news-exposure.png)
<br><small>Figure - Graph showing Participants&#39; Political Knowledge against their exposure to News outlets</small>

Once again, correlation is the only thing that can be inferred; while it might be true that watching more news makes an individual more knowledgeable in political affairs (thus pointing towards news channels as a source of education), and even if that suggestion appears to have an &#39;internal logic&#39;, it could be equally possible from the data that the reverse is true – being more knowledgeable makes one more likely to watch the news. Admittedly, the former explanation seems more logical. Chapter 5 examines these correlations in more detail, and attempts to determine a causal relationship.

## Differences in involvement between Politics and non-Politics students ##

All of the scores above take the sample group as an entirety. In this section the differences between those who have formally studied Politics at any level (i.e. as a degree subject, or during their A-levels), and those who have not, is assessed in greater detail through the evaluation of their various &#39;scores&#39;.

![Figure - Graph showing questionnaire scores for Politics students against non-Politics students]({{site.url}}/assets/images/university/dis-fig6-questionnaire-scores-politics-nonpolitics.png)
<br><small>Figure - Graph showing questionnaire scores for Politics students against non-Politics students</small>

Figure 6 shows the mean scores for both Politics and non-Politics students. [^8]

It is apparent that those who have studied Politics (shown in blue) achieve higher scores than there non-Politics peers (shown in red) throughout, with the exception of the mean knowledge score where the non-Politics students have a marginally higher score.

The most dramatic difference can be found in the &#39;interest&#39; scores, with over 9 percentage points difference between Politics students, scoring a mean average of 82.07% (roughly equivalent to a &#39;4&#39; on Q3.1), and non-Politics students with a mean score of 52.26% (roughly equivalent to a &#39;3&#39; on Q3.1). However, the fact that students of Politics take an interest in political affairs is perhaps the least surprising finding.

Interestingly the participation of those who study politics is markedly higher than non-Politics students. While this in itself should be expected, the results from Figure 4 above show that there is very little correlation between political knowledge and participation. More telling are the results in Figure 6 for the Knowledge scores, which show non-Politics students actually outperforming their Politics peers – albeit by a margin of less than 2 percentage points.

The fact that participation appears to be higher with politics students, but that knowledge in politics does not appear to directly correlate to a higher engagement, suggest that other factors are more important – that politics students have some quality other than political knowledge that makes them more likely to engage.

The participation score. This score is determined by summing the scores from Section 3 of the questionnaire (excluding Q3.1). This includes questions on past voting attendance, as well as expected future voting attendance, and also includes whether the respondent is a member of a political party. Figure 7 shows a breakdown of part of the participation scores.

<br><small>Figure - Graph showing breakdown of &#39;Participation Score&#39; for Politics and non-Politics Students</small>

Here there is a very marked difference in some cases, and some of the results were unexpected. For instance, within the sample population a higher percentage of non-Politics students voted in the 2010 General Election than Politics students (68% of the former, compared with only 53 % of the latter). In addition, a higher percentage of non-Politics students are members of Political Parties – however in this case the difference is so slight that it is barely of significance. Given that the survey was primarily distributed to current students, it was possible that some respondents were not old enough to have voted in their last General Election. However, Questions 3.5c and 3.5d aimed to mitigate this possibility. [^9]

For the purposes of this analysis, rather than lose them from the dataset, any respondent who was too young to have voted in the last election but believed they would have if they were old enough (i.e. answered &#39;Yes&#39; to Q3.5d) was treated as an individual who had voted in the last election. (This was the case for both the General and Local Election question sets.)

Despite this, scores for Politics students voting in their General Elections is dramatically lower. Although there were fields in the questionnaire designed to establish reasons for non-voting, answering these questions was not compulsory and consequently many respondents left them blank. Discussions in the Focus Groups aimed to account for this disparity, and the analysis can be found in Chapter 5.

## Comparison with Denver and Hands ##

The question set in Section 3 of the survey were based on research from a 1990 journal _Does Studying Politics Make a Difference?_ by David Denver and Gordon Hands. They used a specific set of questions to establish a range of benchmarks for the political knowledge of each respondent. Similar questions were chosen in this paper to allow for some comparison between the datasets, and to assess whether political knowledge has changed in the last decade. [^10]

Question 4.3.2 of the questionnaire mirrors a question posed by Denver and Hands. [^11]

Their analysis found that 87% of Politics students knew the statement in question was true, compared with 81% of non-Politics (Denver and Hands 1990, p.266). This compares with 84% of Politics students in the research for this paper who knew the correct answer, and 60% of non-Politics students.

Similarly, Question 4.3.1 was also asked in both surveys. [^12]

Denver and Hands found a much more marked difference, finding that 78% of Politics students knew this to be false, compared with only 23% of non-Politics students (_ibid_., p.267). The research carried out by this paper found that only 48% of Politics students knew this statement was false, however this was still higher than the percentage of non-Politics students, which stood at 26%.

Question 4.2 was also chosen for the questionnaire due to its appearance in Denver and Hands&#39; research. [^13]

They found that 59% of Politics students correctly identified the 3 features of a democracy, compared with only 31% of non-Politics students (_ibid_., p.267). Again, research by this paper found a lower percentage of Politics students correctly naming the 3 features, with 38% of respondents scoring 100% on Q4.2; by contrast only 27% of non-Politics students were able to name the 3.

With the exception of Question 4.3.1, the participants in Denver and Hands&#39; research scored consistently higher than those who answered the questionnaire for this dissertation. Nevertheless, both sets of data show that Politics students are on average more in tune with political affairs than their non-Politics counterparts. Although this is not apparent from looking at the &#39;total Knowledge&#39; (see Figure 7), the questions selected from Denver and Hands were chosen for their relative difficulty. Differences in the results can be explained by a number of factors: firstly, the sample size for Denver and Hands&#39; study was considerably higher, with the first wave of surveys (carried out in 1986 and 1987) involving 6,250 respondents – compared with only 120 for this survey; secondly, it could well be that the sheer amount of information available now compared with a decade ago means that some of the information is lost in the &#39;noise&#39;. The analysis of the Focus Groups in Chapter 5 examines this theory in a little more detail. In addition, the questions posed by this paper offered an &#39;Unsure&#39; option to militate against &#39;false positive&#39; (or correct guess) responses, a feature not included in Denver and Hands&#39; original research. It is possible that respondents who felt &#39;mostly certain&#39; about a response to the questionnaire for this dissertation, but who might have still been hesitant, selected the &#39;Unsure&#39; option for some questions. This would have turned their response into an incorrect one, where they would have chosen for the correct answer in the case of Denver and Hands&#39; research.

Analysis of the questionnaire reveals mixed results. The correlations, where they exist, are weak, and cannot be relied upon solely to establish a link between political education and political engagement. The next Chapter uses more in-depth methods of research to try to establish a connection.

# Chapter 5: Focus Groups and Interviews #

## Assessing Causality: Methodology ##

While the questionnaire and subsequent analysis show a (slight) correlation between education in Politics, and an increase in the likelihood of political engagement, this does not show causality. In addition, while there were opportunities within the questionnaire to explain certain answers to gain a better understanding of some of the anomalous results, not all the answers were accommodating. To combat this, a more rigorous questioning process was needed.

In order to address the issue of causality, and to determine whether there might be a reason for the lack of a greater disparity between Politics and non-Politics students, two focus groups were run. These used a more detailed question base to try and determine the reasons, firstly why Politics was or was not chosen as a further education subject, and secondly whether this decision had any bearing on the level of political involvement the individuals maintained.

## Focus Group 1 ##

The first focus group consisted of 8 individuals of varying degree backgrounds and ages, taking in a cross-section of University of Southampton students. None of the participants in Focus Group 1 have had any formal Politics education (meaning they had not studied the subject at GCSE, A level, or as their degree subject), but by their own admission all maintain at least a basic interest in political affairs. All of the individuals in this group voted in the last General Election.

The theme of the discussion centred on political education for young people, with the participants being asked to describe their background and suggest ways that they would improve the system. A full transcript of this Focus Group can be found in Appendix C.

### Findings: Is education the determining factor?

Interestingly, given that none of the participants had undergone formal Politics education, the level of political interest was relatively high. One participant cited entertainment programmes, such as &#39;Have I Got News For You&#39; as a source of political information. The participant stated that he began reading &#39;Private Eye&#39; magazine because of the programme, thus &#39;educating&#39; him in political affairs. (Male non-Politics Student A, University of Southampton)

The tendency towards &#39;informal&#39; learning of Politics is a theme that came through very strongly in Focus Group 1. Of course, given that the participants in this focus group did not have access to formal Politics education, this is to be expected. However, none of the participants – with one exception – felt this was a major downside. The one that felt disadvantaged said:

> &quot;…to understand Politics you have to have been reading it for a long time… past issues are now affecting the current issues. I didn&#39;t know anything about Politics probably up until the end of Sixth Form, there was no opportunity to learn it… in my school I couldn&#39;t have done Politics and Economics, so I didn&#39;t do Politics.&quot; (Female non-Politics Student A, University of Southampton)

The participant felt that the inability to study Politics at Sixth Form meant that they were now at a disadvantage in following current events, particularly ones with a &#39;back-story&#39;. Another participant corroborated this viewpoint later in the session, arguing that:

> &quot;People know virtually nothingabout 20th Century history… you can&#39;t understand anything about Politics unless you know about 20th Century history and Politics.&quot; (Male non-Politics Student A)

Nevertheless, the consensus with Focus Group 1 was that a more informal style of political education would be beneficial – but that they should be compulsory. Given the recent rise of &#39;single-issue Politics&#39; and the advent of the coalition government, one suggestion was to change the focus of &#39;Politics&#39; as a lesson. One participant said:

> &quot;…the academic subject of Politics is more to do with the institutions – the history of power – as opposed to having a debate about Politics, which I would think is more about policy issues and stuff around a particular debate… That&#39;s what I think people find boring – all the mechanics that go with it… When you do it academically it&#39;s just so dry.&quot; (Male non-Politics Student B, University of Southampton)

Rather than focus on the &quot;mechanics&quot; of Politics, the suggestion is to facilitate more of a discussion on the subject matter. Politics needs to be &quot;…more fun and more compelling for the early age groups.&quot; (Male non-Politics Student A) and the way to do that, in the eyes of Focus Group 1, is to talk more about issues and less about structures.

This, the participants felt, would be more in keeping with the way they had &#39;discovered&#39; Politics. Given that they know all they do of political affairs through no formal education, it seems to be a proven method for transferring information. None of the participants of the focus group were tested, but all were able to maintain a conversation on the subject with fluidity and eloquence. The &#39;natural&#39; and informal way the participants are able to hold a discourse on political affairs lends credence to the notion that a more formalised system is not always the most effective.

## Focus Group 2 ##

The second focus group comprised of 7 students who had a formal background in Political Education. Again, a similar set of questions was asked, but the semi-structured style of the interview allowed for other paths of enquiry to be pursued. In light of the anomalous data from the questionnaires, the focus group with the Politics students was also a chance to further explore any link between studying Politics, and other measures assessed by the survey.

Again, all participants of this focus group were students at the University of Southampton. While not all of them are studying Politics at degree level, those who were not had studied the subject as an A level course. As with the first focus group, all the individuals had voted in the 2010 General Election.

### Findings

As one would expect, the level of political interest within the group was high. Those participants who had not carried the subject on from A level had a notable – albeit slightly so – lower interest. However, these individuals cited a lack of time on top of degree work and extra-curricular activities as the main cause, rather than an inherent lack of interest. One participant said:

> &quot;I do think I&#39;m interested in Politics and the news – at least more so than my housemates [who have not had formal political education], it&#39;s just that on top of my degree and my work with [University society] I don&#39;t really have the time to be actively involved in anything else.&quot; (Female (former) Politics student A, University of Southampton)

This sentiment appeared to be mirrored by several in the group, notably those not taking Politics at degree level. Those studying Politics as a degree found it much easier to talk about current affairs, though one participant admitted that this was almost solely because of his degree:

> &quot;…if I&#39;m honest I don&#39;t know how much I&#39;d pay attention to Politics if I didn&#39;t have to keep up with current affairs for my module. I&#39;m glad I do, but realistically with the workload we&#39;ve got it would probably be the first thing to go if I didn&#39;t have to keep it up.&quot; (Male (current) Politics Student A, University of Southampton)

This, along with a selection of others from this focus group, highlights a potential reason for the anomalous results from the questionnaire, specifically the low turnout by Politics students at the General Election. Although the entire group had voted in the General Election, one participant offered that University life itself was the major road-block in Political participation – not just for Elections, but participation in general:

> &quot;It&#39;s easy to lose yourself in your little bubble when you&#39;re at Uni… I still think it&#39;s hard to miss something big like the General Election, but I guess there are a lot of things that just pass you by when you&#39;re here.&quot; (Female (current) Politics Student B, University of Southampton)

However, while this might explain the lack of participation for Politics students at the Elections, the same effect should also be seen on non-Politics students. In other words, this explanation accounts for the low participation of Politics students, but not that their participation is lower than non-Politics students.

While no one in Focus Group 2 was adamant that Political Education be made compulsory, all the participants agreed that it was a worthwhile subject. This concurs with the sentiments of Focus Group 1, but while the latter argued that a more informal style of education should be introduced, Focus Group 2 felt that a formal structure was the best way of disseminating information. This disparity between the two groups is perhaps to be expected, given their respective backgrounds. The respondents in Focus Group 1 however, did seem to be more able to justify their desire for informal education, whilst Focus Group 2 aspirations appeared to be limited to maintaining the status quo. Any further investigation into the merits of either style of education should be mindful of this apparent phenomenon.

## Interviews 1 and 2 ##

In addition to Focus Groups, interviews with participants were also conducted. While the former allow for a broad exploration of relatively detailed viewpoints, the latter allowed for a much more in-depth discussion, and provided the opportunity to really clarify any points made. Two interviews were conducted, and they followed a structured question list. The responses from the participants could therefore be cross-examined, and any differences analysed in context.

Interview 1 was conducted with a Male student from the University of Kent. The participant studies Politics at degree level, and maintains an interest in Political affairs. Interview 2 was conducted with a Female student from the University of Southampton who does not have a formal Politics education. A full transcript of both Interview 1 and Interview 2 can be found in Appendix C.

### Findings

The main focus of the questions in both interviews was the way in which Politics is seen by the participants, with respect to formal education, and &#39;soft&#39; media, and how it enables participation of young people.

Interviewee 1 offered a more eloquent discourse on the subject, his education in Politics was apparent. Throughout the discussion, he advocated compulsory formal education, in direct contrast to the thoughts of Focus Group 1. When asked if Politics should be made a compulsory subject, he replied:

> &quot;Yes absolutely. It&#39;s not an easy thing to get your head around - voting systems etc. But even if you don&#39;t care how they work, it&#39;s important to have a basic understanding.&quot;

When questioned about whether this political education should focus more on single-issue Politics, or on the way the political system works (a discussion that was held by both Focus Groups), he argued in favour of a more systematic style of teaching:

> &quot;Mechanics are a lot more important. It [Politics] should be taught in the same way maths etc is taught - doesn&#39;t matter if they enjoy it, they need to know it… Single issues are a good way to engage in debate, but single issues aren&#39;t the most important things. They&#39;ll be able to discuss in the next General Election, but 5 years down the line when a new set of issues comes along they won&#39;t be able to talk about… If you teach about a single issue, as soon as that&#39;s not longer an issue their education becomes invalid.&quot;

Overall, Interviewee 1&#39;s feelings towards Political education provide a stark contrast to that of Focus Group 1. Interestingly, his opinions appear to align much more with those of Focus Group 2. This is an important factor, as Interviewee 1 studies at the University of Kent, whereas both sets of Focus Groups are comprised entirely of students from the University of Southampton. This shows that the similarity in thought is a factor held in common across degree disciplines, not across university campuses.

Despite studying Politics, and having a good understanding of political affairs, Interviewee 1 did admit to being &quot;…apathetic to actually being able to change anything&quot; showing that despite having a post-16 education, participation is based in this case on other things. This corroborates the findings of other aspects of this research, with participants citing time as the main factor acting as a barrier to their participation, and research done by the _Audit of Political Engagement 8_ which cited participants claiming their lack of participation was due to a lack of knowledge of events, not because they were not interested (2010, p.48-50).

By contrast, Interviewee 2, who has not studied Politics formally at any point, perhaps unsurprisingly held similar views to those of Focus Group 1. A notable difference between Interviewees 1 and 2 were the thoughts on the importance of single-issue politics, with the latter arguing that it would be &quot;…a lot easier to get enthused about a particular thing if it relates to you,&quot; instead of having to learn arbitrary facts about Parliament. This highlights an interesting difference in opinion between those who have studied Politics, and those who have not; as with the Focus Group participants, the method in which one learns about Politics influences the way in which an individual would recommend.

# Chapter 6: Conclusion #

## Limitations to the study ##

While this study aimed to be as holistic and in depth as was plausible, there were a number of limitations that could be addressed in further research.

The &#39;Knowledge Score&#39; used throughout is based on the answers to 3 question blocks, with a possible high score of only 16. This allows only a limited scope for analysis, a point that may go some way to explaining the anomalous results. However, while the research that this was based on was comprised of a much larger number of questions (Denver and Hands 1990, p.267), the reason such a short question set was chosen for this paper was in order to not discourage participants from responding. By its nature, the study required the participation of both politically interested and politically dis-interested people. Thus if the question set had been too long, those on the politically dis-interested end of the spectrum may well have abandoned the survey, depriving the dataset of important results.

Nevertheless, the questionnaire appears to have suffered from self-selection bias. Of those who completed the questionnaire, over half (68%) gave a score of 4 or 5 to Question 3.1, showing an interest in Politics. Only 9% of respondents, by contrast, admitted to not being interested, scoring themselves a 1 or 2 on the question. 23% of respondents scored themselves a 3, showing them to be fairly neutral.

![Figure - Graph showing responses to Q3.1]({{site.url}}/assets/images/university/dis-fig8-q3-responses.png)
<br><small>Figure - Graph showing responses to Q3.1</small>

This could be mitigated in further research by conducting the questionnaire in a different setting. Rather than having it solely online and waiting for people to complete it, further questionnaires could be handed out in hard-copy form or through a direct email to selected individuals (in line with the Quota sampling method). The reason this was not chosen for this dissertation was that response rates for email surveys have been shown to be less than desirable, with one study by Couper _et al_ showing a non-response rate to an email questionnaire at 52.9% (2001, p.241). However, with a large enough population, this low response rate can be overcome.

## Should post-16 political education be recommended? ##

The results from this research have been varied. While the questionnaire revealed higher participation scores for those who studied politics, this heightened engagement did not appear to be a direct result of the political education itself. When tested, there was little difference in the political knowledge of the Politics and non-Politics students, with the latter in fact coming out on top. When examined further, the &#39;more technical&#39; politics questions were answered correctly with greater frequency by the politics students, but this in itself did not contribute to the increased participation. Furthermore, when looking at the sample population as a whole, there appeared to be little correlation between political knowledge and participation.

Meanwhile the results of the focus groups and interviews appear to paint a different picture. Interviewee 1 claimed that studying Politics did not directly influence his knowledge of political affairs. While it is true that one participant from Focus Group 2 admitted that without studying Politics he would probably not be as well versed in political affairs, there was an almost unanimous call from Focus Group 1 to adopt a more informal style of political education to engage a much larger audience of young people. It should be noted that, even among those who had not formally studied Politics, a near-unanimous call for mandatory political education was apparent.

Research from other sources, including the Hansard Society&#39;s _Audit of Political Engagement 8_, appears to concur with these findings. While _Audit 8_ states that higher levels of education are a strong determining factor in the engagement of individuals, it does not specify that this is the key to political engagement. Rather than being educated formally, participants of _Audit 8_ called for more information on opportunities to get involved (2011, p.49) In addition, participants (notably the younger age groups) felt that civic engagement was more beneficial than political involvement (_ibid._, pp.45-6), leading _Audit 8_ to call for a change in the language used (_ibid._, p.50). This again mirrors the results from this paper&#39;s research, with one Focus Group participant stating &quot;…maybe also not calling it &#39;Politics&#39; because so many people just switch off.&quot; (Male non-Politics Student B) Another made the point that &quot;Politics affects everything,&quot; and so everyone should be interested in a certain aspect of Politics – a name change may be enough to change the stigma (Female non-Politics Student A). The participants of this research, it seems, believe that engagement can be encouraged through fairly simple measures.

Using likelihood to vote in a general election as a measure however (as seen in _Audit 8_ (2011, p.67)) shows that the key determinates do not appear to be education at all. The _Audit_ itself cites that the most recent general election was &quot;the first &#39;change&#39; election of their voting lives…&quot; meaning that the outcome would most dramatically affect them. Personal investment then, not outside education, appears to be the defining factor. It is beyond the scope of this dissertation to answer the question of what most influences political engagement, expect to offer the opinion that formal education – while evidently important, is not it.

## A final word ##

The issue of political engagement has long been a contentious one within Politics. The question of how to motivate the public into participating is one that has been around for decades, and does not seem set to go away anytime soon. The very latest Hansard Publication – _Audit of Political Engagement 9_ – shows a bleaker picture still than that of _Audit 8_ that has been referenced throughout this dissertation. With this in mind, it seems ever more vital that young people are encouraged early on to develop an interest.

This paper has shown that taking an interest in Politics does not necessarily mean having to commit to a degree in Political Science – there are many people from a diverse range of academic backgrounds who show that taking an interest in Politics does not mean one has to study the subject throughout one&#39;s academic life. One thing that has stood out throughout in the research for this dissertation is that an interest in Politics can be generated through informal as well as formal education, meaning that there is every reason why more people can become engaged.

A formal post-16 education in Politics does appear to encourage individuals to become more politically aware; but it is not the only determining factor, and it does not appear to be the biggest.

## Appendix C – Transcripts ##

### Focus Group 1

This focus group consisted of 7 individuals of varying degree backgrounds and ages, taking in a cross-section of University of Southampton students. None of the participants in Focus Group 1 have had any formal politics education, but all voted in the last General Election.

By their own admission, they all maintain at least a basic interest in political affairs.

**Would you consider yourselves interested in politics?**

_General consensus within the group_

> M1: Slightly

**Would anyone like to elaborate?**

> M1: depends on what you mean by how interested. I read the news

> M2: I enjoy slating politicians, that&#39;s quite fun

> F1: I hate politics, so I figure that counts as interested in a way

> M2: You&#39;re passionate about it

> F2: I&#39;m interested but not knowledgeable enough about it – I don&#39;t read around the subject enough. I should read around it more.

> M3: I kind of just see what I see in the media and take that for granted, I don&#39;t really know what&#39;s actually going on.

**So you say you don&#39;t read around, you get most of your exposure through TV media?**

> M3: Yea I watch the news (on TV) and I occasionally see a paper, but I don&#39;t take it upon myself to look up articles and delve deeper into stuff

> M1: Yea, I&#39;m doing Economics (as a subject) and I saw today there was a double dip recession. I just read it and though &#39;ah ok&#39; – that was it, I didn&#39;t even click on the link. I was just like &#39;that&#39;s all I need to know really&#39;. I went on the website to see what was going on, but I didn&#39;t actually care.

**Why do you think that is? Do you think that&#39;s something inherent to you, do you think that&#39;s the way you&#39;ve been schooled?**

> M1: I kind of feel a bit bored with it. There&#39;s so much going on at the moment – you just hear headline after headline and are just like &#39;ah its &quot;breaking news&quot;, well I heard breaking news yesterday.

> F1: I think with &#39;breaking news&#39; is always depressing

> M4: I think it&#39;s our generation as well – there&#39;s so much information out there on the internet. The phrase &#39;too long, didn&#39;t read&#39; springs to mind. You see all the stuff and there&#39; just so much to choose from to read that you don&#39;t end up getting anything. You get little bits of everything.

> F2: I think as well to understand politics you have to have been reading it for a long time to understand past issues that are now affecting the current issues. I know that I didn&#39;t know anything about politics probably up until the end of Sixth Form, so there was no opportunity where I had to be force to learn it. It all would have been off my own accord and it&#39;s not really like taught in schools – in my school I couldn&#39;t have done politics and economics, so I didn&#39;t do politics. So I think there should be more focus around the subject in Sixth Form&#39;s and things.

**How would you go about that? There are &#39;citizenship&#39; style classes at the moment – do you think it can be incorporated into that, should it be a standalone subject? Do you think it should be compulsory?**

> F2: Yea it should definitely be compulsory

> M1: Like in tutor groups and stuff you could just talk about what went on during the week. At the moment kids are clueless – they don&#39;t care.

> F2: Yea have like debates and stuff – discussions.

**So not necessarily a formal lesson as such?**

> M1: Like a newsround! Like a newsround in the school where people could talk about it. If you started teaching 12 year olds about a double-dip recession – I mean I don&#39;t care about it, why would they care?

> M4: I&#39;d say link it in with History as well. People have such a poor knowledge of History and it&#39;s not even compulsory to do history to GCSE. People know virtually nothing about 20th Century history anyway and you can&#39;t understand anything about politics unless you know about 20th Century history and politics.

> F2: Maybe there should be like – you know how we have so many societies – maybe there should be groups of people who are involved with it within Sixth Forms. At University obviously there&#39;s that opportunity, but I know that Sixth Forms don&#39;t have a lot of scope for those sorts of things.

> M1: Maybe also not calling it &#39;Politics&#39; because so many people just switch off.

> F2: Yea definitely, maybe calling it like &#39;Current affairs&#39; or something – or &#39;Current issues&#39;. The thing is politics affects everything, so whether people are interested in politics or not, certain issues in politics would affect – say – education, or travelling or something, loads of different things. So there are difference aspects within politics that someone surely should be interested in.

> F1: Maybe they should just put it into PSHE (?) – We had something called &#39;Personal Social Heath Education&#39; at school but I can&#39;t remember anything about it, so they should probably stick some politics in there – because we certainly didn&#39;t gain anything from it.

> M5: It&#39;s because as well the academic subject of politics is more to do with the institutions – the history of power – as opposed to having a debate about politics, which I would think is more about policy issues and stuff around a particular debate. You would need prior knowledge, but you wouldn&#39;t necessarily need prior knowledge about the institution itself. That&#39;s what I think people find boring – all the mechanics that go with it, rather than &#39;oh I just want to talk about this&#39;.

**So you think focus on single issues?**

> M5: Yea, for me the paradigm of politics is like this thing I listen to all the time called &#39;London&#39;s Biggest Conversation&#39; – basically it&#39;s just a debate question will come on and then loads of different people from different backgrounds will come and talk about it. That&#39;s kind of what I see politics as. But when you do it academically it&#39;s just so dry – &#39;oh this is the House of Lords, and this does that with that, and then this is the legislative process…&#39;

> M2: There are debating classes so you could tie it into that

> M3: Politicians have a reputation, so most of them go to Oxford or Cambridge, so you don&#39;t feel like you can really relate to them.

> M1: Yea and then everyone says they&#39;re liars and stuff, so why would you really care about politics.

> M3: its seems like a different class of people almost

> M5: And that&#39;s going back to the mechanics of it – you feel like you can&#39;t get involved because you don&#39;t know the mechanics

> M2: I don&#39;t feel I would ever become a politician – I could never break into that circle.

**So there is a consensus then that there isn&#39;t enough political education – however we chose to define that – at a younger age. And we think that there should be some kind of either informal or semi-structured way of doing that – not necessarily focusing on the mechanics of it, but on discussing individual issues. That&#39;s kind of the way forward?**

> M5: I think we should be getting people interested in issues really at a young age.

**Good – so what kind of age group are we thinking of aiming this at?**

> F1: I think 12 onwards – secondary school onwards

> M3: There&#39;s no clear way into politics. Like if I wanted to go into politics there&#39;s no set path – I&#39;ve no idea of a system in place that would get me into politics.

> F3: Yea as soon as I turned 18 I was &#39;oh I&#39;m able to vote&#39; but I don&#39;t think I was able to use my vote as well as I could have done. And also I think you&#39;ve got a lot of your family&#39;s views potentially – that&#39;s where I heard most of my info on politics from. Realistically they could easily be biased and would then influence me.

> F1: Do you think also the school system is very much tied in by the National Curriculum? There&#39;s no subject that&#39;s just &#39;we&#39;re going to talk about current affairs&#39; – it&#39;s all something that&#39;s been written out for the teacher to deliver in every single lesson. So nowhere throughout school, until you get to Sixth Form, do they ever say &#39;so what are you guys interested in, what do you think?&#39;

> M5: Yea you can see why it is boring, why no one would want to do anything to do with politics.

> M4: You need to make it more fun and more compelling for the early age groups. The reason I got interested in politics – it&#39;s a massive cliché – but it was because I was obsessed with &#39;Rage against the machine&#39; when I was like 12. Because all their songs had political issues, I&#39;d look into the Zapatista Movement, Marxism, and stuff – just as a result of being into their songs.

> M3: As a young kid it might be quite cool to play some sort of simulation where you are in control of the country. Be the Prime Minister – as a young kind you&#39;d really enjoy doing that! See how your relationship with certain people would affect things. That&#39;d be pretty amazing.

> M5: Did you guys not do MUN (Model United Nations)? You pretend to be part of the UN – you all get different things, like Security Council or whatever.

_General consensus &#39;I&#39;ve heard of that yea&#39;_

> F2: Yea maybe have more things in schools like that. I know in Sixth Form I had an economics competition – Target 2.0 – where you set the interest rates and stuff. That was quite fun because we got together as a group of us from our economics class and we could just talk about it and present it. Maybe more little competitions for people who are interested in the subject, just to make it more fun – because people do judge the issue of politics quite a lot and its very very stereotyped in terms of you know, only rich people who went to Oxford or Cambridge get into politics very high up. There&#39;s quite a lot of prejudice around issues within politics. So maybe to open that up so people can understand some of the issues that maybe they thought they knew how they are, actually they aren&#39;t.

> F1: You could literally say to the kids just watch newsround or Question Time and we&#39;ll talk about it tomorrow. It&#39;s not the most difficult homework in the world.

> M4: Or like &#39;Have I Got News For You&#39; – it&#39;s funny, but you learn a lot about politics watching it.

**What do you think of topical panel based entertainment shows (Have I Got News For You, 8 out of 10 Cats, 10 o&#39;clock Live, etc) as a delivery mechanism for political education?**

> M4: I think it&#39;s good. I mean I started reading &#39;Private Eye&#39; when I was 16 because of HIGNFY because I really liked Ian Hislop

> F1: But then with these kinds of programmes they are quite jaded and there&#39;s just endless criticism – like &#39;oh this person is shit, and this person is shit&#39; and the actual theme is always criticism and making fun of people. So I think it&#39;s good initially, but I think you have to take that bias into account.

**Do you think that&#39;s a problem with politics in general…?**

>F1: I think it&#39;s always going to happen, when someone has power over everyone else – everyone else is going to be a bit grumpy about it. That&#39;s sort of the way human beings work isn&#39;t it.

**But then is that something that the TV programmes are creating – that aura of criticism, or are they just feeding off of it?**

> F3: I&#39;d say creating it. Most of the times when you&#39;re watching these programmes you are like &#39;yea this is very funny&#39;, but it is just taking the piss out of other people.

> M4: That&#39;s what satire is, isn&#39;t it? I think you can&#39;t be satirical if you&#39;re being positive – it just doesn&#39;t work.

> F3: My view of politics sometimes is just that people get very cross at each other and angry.

> M4: Can you imagine Charlie Brooker presenting Newswipe if he wasn&#39;t in a foul mood? It just wouldn&#39;t work would it?

> F1: I remember watching some old footage of HIGNFY when they were taking the piss out of Princess Diana and calling her a massive slag, and that was really difficult to watch because we all got brought up with her as this idol. So watching them being like &#39;oh my god she shagged the entire rugby team&#39; was a bit like &#39;was that really necessary?&#39; just because she&#39;s a figure in the public eye, does that mean you have to criticise her?

> M2: Look at Boris Johnson, he used to host it and now they just slate him

> M3: I think politics needs more characters like Boris Johnson – he&#39;s just a hero.

> F1: No he&#39;s not – he&#39;s just giving tax breaks to the rich.

> M5: I like satirical things because you don&#39;t necessarily have to like jokes to like politics. I think the tone of the media, that is very highly critical. It&#39;s kind of like free in the sense that they can just criticise anyone without doing anything themselves.

> M2: Criticism, the idea of it, is to make sure they are going down the right path. Everything they do wrong is heavily criticised. That&#39;s a good thing.

> M5: Yea, but when you are influencing public opinion –

> M2: As soon as the media is influenced and controlled that&#39;s when you get a dictatorship. You need the free media

> M5: Yea you need the free media but

> F1: But don&#39;t you think the free media very rarely goes &#39;look at this decision the politicians have made – isn&#39;t it fantastic!&#39; it doesn&#39;t encourage people to go into politics, because if you go into politics then public opinion, and the TV, will criticise you.

> M4: The problem is that people are poorly informed by the media. You just have to look at fact that the Daily Mail&#39;s website is one of the biggest news websites on the internet. That&#39;s really fucking depressing. People are poorly informed by these things.

> F1: They don&#39;t reference or cite properly!

> M4: It hurts to read it. And the fact that so many people do read it makes you think that&#39;s why people are poorly informed.

**But then are you in danger of being two steps away from having a controlled media?**

> F1: You should have to cite stuff properly – you can&#39;t just make stuff up!

> M5: But there you&#39;re creating an air of scepticism that&#39;s all it is

> M4: The problem is that people are basing their ideas on a publication that will tell you one thing causes cancer one month, and then cures it the next.

**Do you think there is enough exposure to politics – the right kind of exposure – specifically towards young people?**

> F1: No – because they aren&#39;t trying to get young people&#39;s votes. They&#39;re trying to get middle-aged votes. The older you get the more likely you are to vote, so they don&#39;t every try and get 16 year olds interested because they won&#39;t get any votes out of them.

> M1: Is there any exposure to young people? Other than Newsround, is there anything directed at kids at all?

> F4: They did it in my college, where they came – a member of the party came round. But that didn&#39;t make me vote.

> F1: I got a letter from the Lib Dems when I turned 18 saying &#39;we want to get rid of tuition fees – vote for us!&#39; That&#39;s the only thing I&#39;ve got

> M4: See this is the thing. Before the last elections I said it won&#39;t happen, tuition fees won&#39;t be cut, if anything they&#39;re going to be raised – they probably should be raised a little. Lib Dems won&#39;t get into power unless there&#39;s a coalition. And I&#39;ve always voted Lib Dem – I&#39;ve been a Lib Dem supporter – but when it came to it I didn&#39;t agree with their manifesto and I didn&#39;t see it happening, so I voted Labour. If you look into these things properly, you could see these things were going to happen. But instead people though &#39;fuck – tuition fees! They&#39;re going to cut them – even though it won&#39;t affect us – we&#39;re going to vote for them!&quot; People need to look into it more deeply.

**The big things with the last elections were the TV debates; do you think they were a good idea?**

> M4: Well that&#39;s when people started noticing Nick Clegg wasn&#39;t it.

> F1: They were terrible! It was just based on how good a public speaker you were.

> F4: I agree that they probably aren&#39;t the most efficient way, but how many people actually watched them? Loads! It worked.

> F2: I think they&#39;re a good way of provoking a discussion amongst people. So if everyone has seen it, it&#39;s a good talking point.

> F4: Yea loads of people were talking about it after it happened as well.

> F1: But the impression you get is how good a public speaker the party leader is, and the party leader shouldn&#39;t be party leader based on that. They should be party leader because they believe in the manifesto.

**Do you worry then that no one was reading the manifestos anymore – they were just basing their decision on the performance?**

> F1: Yea – Nick Clegg was a good public speaker, Gordon Brown wasn&#39;t

> F4: It could work either way. I know I probably looked up some manifestos because I saw them on TV

> M2: But your decision part of the brain is where you believe things, it&#39;s not where you rationally think, so you&#39;re actually much more likely to vote for someone you believe in. If you like someone, you believe in them, rather than actually what they are saying.

> F1: It should be followed up by something with extra stuff, reinforcing it – this is the manifesto, these are the main points, the main belief system that this party is coming from, these are the key areas that they are going to be looking into. Rather than everyone basing it on how one person answered a few random questions.

> F4: But I do think that there are more benefits to it that there are drawbacks.

> F2: I think young people are the most easily influenced by their peers, and by their family upbringings. And that&#39;s why it&#39;s very rare that in a family you&#39;ll get conflicting political ideas, because young people have no other option than to follow what their parents have voted for. When I didn&#39;t understand any politics, I&#39;d ask my parents who they were voting for and then be like &#39;yea okay I&#39;ll vote for them&#39;.

> M4: Really? I&#39;ve had a completely different approach. I was always a bit like whatever they vote for I&#39;ll vote for the opposite.

> F4: But when I was younger I voted what my parents voted because I thought it&#39;s going to affect them more than it will affect me. As soon as I could vote, I voted for what my parents voted for because a lot of the stuff didn&#39;t apply to us.

### Interview 1

This interview questioned a male Politics student from the University of Kent.

**Would you consider yourselves interested in politics?**

> Yes; I follow current affairs as best I can, though if I&#39;m honest I&#39;m apathetic to actually being able to change anything.

**You don&#39;t think a citizen can affect change?**

> It depends on the citizen, how much time they have, financial backing etc. I&#39;d like to think that if I really tried I could change something in Westminster. But in reality I&#39;m limited by what I can actually devote.

**You study Politics &#39;formally&#39;, how would you say you get most of your exposure to Political Affairs?**

> I&#39;d say most of my exposure is actually through personal interest. It might be due to my module choices, but I don&#39;t have much exposure to British politics through my Uni degree – particularly not contemporary politics. I&#39;ve taken modules in modern political thought, but I wouldn&#39;t say that&#39;s the same as knowledge of current affairs. What I know of British and EU politics get from more informed classmates - but not in an official classroom sense. Studying politics helps, but because of exposure through others, not through formal education.

**Do you think having that formal education beyond A-levels in any way enhances your ability to &#39;keep up&#39; with current affairs?**

> I&#39;ve got no substantive proof, but I think people who go onto further education are more likely to want an interest in politics and current affairs. By virtue of them taking further education they are more likely to be able to articulate arguments etc. The reasons people go into Further Education are the same reasons they are able to articulate arguments well. It also depends on what you do with you time at university. Uni gives you a chance to meet people with the same politically minded – not necessarily the same thoughts on parties and policies etc, but the same interest. University doesn&#39;t necessarily give me a better access to information, but it does provide the right sort of culture. For instance, the library etc does provide newspapers, but can&#39;t remember the last time I read one.

**Do you think Politics education should be compulsory at any point during education? (At what age?)**

> Yes absolutely. It&#39;s not an easy thing to get your head around - voting systems etc. But even if you don&#39;t care how they work, it&#39;s important to have a basic understanding. Especially when it comes to being able to hold people to account - you need to understand how the system works if you are able to hold anyone to account. When people are trying to make Parliament or the EU or whatever more transparent, you need to couple that with actual knowledge on how it works. That sort of education needs to exist as a minimum. People argue it would be easy for a teacher to manipulate towards a particular viewpoint, but if done properly, the social benefits of political education outweigh and dangers.

**Do you think there is more of an interest in recent times on single-issue Politics? Should this be reflected in teaching styles? Or do you think that the &#39;mechanics&#39; of the political system is a more important concept to get across?**

> Mechanics are a lot more important. It should be taught in the same way maths etc is taught - doesn&#39;t matter if they enjoy it, they need to know it. Start at year 7 - if taught properly, an 11 year old is more than capable of learning about government. Start at the local level - rather than explain the pros of FPTP vs other system, it would be better to explain what the local council etc does. Knowing what to expect of particular bodies and where their responsibilities lie is more important. Taught as a practical - this is what you need to know subject.

**And what about single issue politics?**

> Single issues are a good way to engage in debate, but single issues aren&#39;t the most important things. They&#39;ll be able to discuss in the next General Election, but 5 years down the line when a new set of issues comes along they won&#39;t be able to talk about. Teach them about the system and the mechanics is more like teaching them to fish (as opposed to giving them a fish to feed themselves for a day, teach them to fish and feed for a life time). Politics doesn&#39;t have to change the world - there are layers local government that are more assessable than Westminster. They can deal with more day to day issues.
> 
> If you teach about a single issue, as soon as that&#39;s not longer an issue their education becomes invalid. Also, biasing a class is a lot easier when you are talking about a single issue. If you are just explaining how the system works then it&#39;s a lot harder to bias, rather than talking about the pros cons of fox hunting.

**What do you think of topical panel based entertainment shows (Have I Got News For You, 8 out of 10 Cats, 10 o&#39;clock Live, etc) as a delivery mechanism for political education?**

> Really good - they are a great way of holding people to account, albeit not necessarily in a very serious way. I find with the topical panel shows (eg HIGNFY) you need to have an idea of what&#39;s going on for it to be funny. They don&#39;t teach you - well they do, but you need an understanding first. It almost rewards you for understanding politics.

**TV programmes have been criticised for being too negative and cynical. Do you think this is true, and if so, is this something TV is creating – that aura of criticism, or are they just feeding off of it?**

> Feeding off of it - not creating. Cynical humour is funnier - it&#39;s not funny unless something is going wrong. I can see what the critics mean though - I can&#39;t remember the last time HIGNFY praised someone without a hint of cynicism. If HIGNFY suddenly started praising, rather than slating the bad things, people would find it funny. Then again 10oclock (10 o&#39;clock Live) has episodes where they openly praise stuff, so it does go both ways.

**Do you think there is enough exposure to politics – the right kind of exposure – specifically towards young people?**

> Not at all. It goes back to how you need to understand various bodies etc and how they work. There needs to be more local issues explained - if young people have issues that can be resolved through political change, and how they can exploit that, rather than just moaning about the issues. It&#39;s hard to force someone to take an interest, in anything, if you&#39;re going to follow current affairs then you need access to the news - find time to watch it, or read a quality paper every day. If you&#39;re reading more &#39;accessible&#39; papers - such as _The Daily Mail_ or _The Sun_ - then you also need to read something at the other end of the spectrum - something closer to the truth. But people don&#39;t because The Sun is 20p and has naked women in it. It&#39;s very cleverly written with a bias - not obviously, but it does have bias. It&#39;s very easy to feel disengaged by watching the news.

**And what are your thoughts on social media?**

> Negative towards social media because I&#39;ve never got into it - maybe I&#39;m missing a trick. I&#39;ve always seen it as competition - I&#39;ve read these articles because I&#39;m clever; but its 3 articles from the &#39;in other news&#39; section of the Guardian.
> 
> Then you&#39;ll get some who write good responses, but the everyday user - Facebook isn&#39;t&#39; the right tool to absorb that kind of content or to affect change.
> 
> Twitter - can you really talk coherently in 140 characters? Good for sharing articles, but personally my experience with twitter hasn&#39;t been enlightening.

**The big things with the last elections were the TV debates; do you think they were a good idea?**

> They were definitely a huge influence on voting. It consolidated a lot of the key issues debates that were going round the country; you could hear the top parties answer to those debates. In that respect it made it easy to see answers to those debates. The problem was that it became almost like a presidential campaign, you voted for the party leader, not for the party and its manifesto. If it was a presidential election it would have been fine, but as it was it detracted from the sense that the Westminster system is one based in legislature - the party leader isn&#39;t supreme. If you just vote or the party leader,  you miss out a lot of the stuff - he is a good representation of what the party stands for, but the local people (who you vote for) don&#39;t always toe the party line. If you base your vote on what one says, and then vote for the other then there is a disconnect.

### Interview 2

This interview was conducted with a 20 year old Female student of the University of Southampton. The participant has never studied Politics in a formal educational setting.

**Would you consider yourselves interested in politics?**

> I would say I&#39;m interested, but I don&#39;t really know all that much about it.

**You don&#39;t study Politics &#39;formally&#39;, how would you say you get most of your exposure to Political Affairs?**

> Most of what I know about current affairs is through the TV – I watch BBC news whenever I can. I should probably read the paper, but it takes too long to read the whole thing, and the quality ones are too expensive to just skim read them.

**Do you think not having a formal education in Politics affects your ability to &#39;keep up&#39; with current affairs?**

> I think I probably am at a slight disadvantage, but then saying that if I did do Politics I&#39;d probably end up resenting it. I&#39;d do it all the time and then I just wouldn&#39;t want to engage anymore.

**Do you think Politics education should be compulsory at any point during education? (At what age?)**

> Never really thought about it, but yea it would probably help. A lot of people think they know a lot about Political affairs, when actually they are completely ignorant about it all.

**How would you go about that? There are &#39;citizenship&#39; style classes at the moment – do you think it can be incorporated into that, should it be a standalone subject? Do you think it should be compulsory?**

> I think embed it into Citizenship and PSHE (Physical, Social, and Health Education). Politics is quite a boring subject, so having it in that kind of environment might make it a little more accessible.

**Do you think there is more of an interest in recent times on single-issue Politics? Should this be reflected in teaching styles?**

> I think there probably is more of an interest in single-issues. It&#39;s a lot easier to get enthused about a particular thing if it relates to you, rather than trying to remember all the stuff about laws and Parliament and things.

**What do you think of topical panel based entertainment shows (Have I Got News For You, 8 out of 10 Cats, 10 o&#39;clock Live, etc) as a delivery mechanism for political education?**

> I watch them from time to time. I think they are quite entertaining, but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d say they were good as an educational tool. I suppose it&#39;s a fun way of keeping up with current affairs, but you couldn&#39;t get any real depth of the issues.

**TV programmes have been criticised for being too negative and cynical. Do you think this is true, and if so, is this something TV is creating – that aura of criticism, or are they just feeding off of it?**

> I think it&#39;s just the style of humour we have. As a nation we find cynicism funny. It&#39;s a bit of both – there does seem to be an air of negativity about Politics, but I don&#39;t think the TV programmes fuel that. It&#39;s a different type – it&#39;s not always malicious with things like Have I Got News For You.

**Do you think there is enough exposure to politics – the right kind of exposure – specifically towards young people?**

> I don&#39;t know if there is any Politics exposure for the younger generation is there? At least nothing specifically aimed at younger people. There could definitely be more – I think if there was more it would help with general engagement in Politics. There is definitely a sense that Politicians, don&#39;t really have time for anyone younger than like 29. That sense of isolation from things could be easily fixed with a little direct engagement I think.

**The big things with the last elections were the TV debates; do you think they were a good idea?**

> Yea, to a point. It was good because it made everything a bit more prominent – like it was a talking point for everyone &quot;did you see the debates last night?&quot; which is not something you&#39;d ever have thought you&#39;d hear.

**Do you worry then that no one was reading the manifestos anymore – they were just basing their decision on the performance?**

> I guess that could have been a problem. It did turn it into a bit of a popularity contest – I&#39;d have thought especially with any younger viewers. But then they did discuss the policy points, so it&#39;s not like they ignored the manifestos completely.

[^4]: NOTE: this is true in some cases, but in others &#39;Unsure&#39; and &#39;No&#39; / &#39;False&#39; responses were treated as the same. A full explanation is provided in the main body of the text where appropriate.

[^5]: Note that there was an &#39;Unsure&#39; option to militate against false positives in the data table (i.e. people guessing the correct answer), but in the analysis &#39;False&#39; and &#39;Unsure&#39; were treated as the same.

[^6]: In order to calculate Spearman&#39;s Rank Correlation Co-efficient, the computer software SPSS was used.

[^7]: A note on the involvement scores: Question 3.10 asked respondents to rank on a Likert scale of 1 to 5 how involved in decision making they would like to be at various levels. The responses included an &#39;N/A&#39; option for those participants who could not answer – for instance, those in Full-time Education who could not specify how much involvement in decision making they would want to have in employment. This was adjusted for in the results, and the percentage figure obtained took into account the missing field.

[^8]: Here the &#39;Interest&#39; score has been converted from the Likert score into a percentage (i.e. a Likert score of 1 is equivalent to 20%, 2 is 40%, etc. up to 5 is 100%) to allow a direct comparison with the other scores.

[^9]: Question 3.5c – &quot;For what reason (did you not vote in the last Local Election)? [Not old enough / Other (please specify)]&quot;, Question 3.5d &quot;If you had been old enough, do you think you would have voted? [Yes / No / Unsure]&quot;

[^10]: Certain questions asked by Denver and Hands have been modified for a more contemporary context. For instance, Denver and Hands asked respondents to state whether the following was &#39;True&#39; or &#39;False&#39; – &quot;The leader of the Soviet Union is Yuri Andropov&quot;. This question was altered in the questionnaire for this paper to &quot;Nicholas Sarkozy is the current Prime Minister of France&quot;, for two reasons: firstly, there is no longer a Soviet Union, and so the question in its original form is redundant; secondly, that Sarkozy is actually the French President (not the Prime Minister) was deemed a good separating signal of more detailed Political knowledge.

[^11]: Question 4.3.2 &quot;The United States of America is a member of NATO&quot; [True / False / Unsure]

[^12]: Question 4.3.1 &quot;There are 475 MPs in the House of Commons&quot; [True / False / Unsure]

[^13]: Question 4.2 &quot;Please select 3 of the following 7 options that you believe are essential for a democracy:&quot; [A monarch / A free media / A Prime Minister / A House of Lords / More than one political party / One person one vote / A written constitution]
