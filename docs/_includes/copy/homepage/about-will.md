# Will Ranjan-Churchill
## Technology Adviser, Web Developer
I’m Will, and like most people I wear a lot of hats. One thing that I try to keep constant though is that I’m passionate about driving effective change, and enabling others to realise their potential.

For over a decade I’ve worked in technology and tech transformation across a range of sectors, including charity foundations and social enterprises, healthcare, and in education. In addition, as co-founder of a web-agency, I’ve helped dozens of social organisations get the most out of their online presence.

I'd love to help you and your organisaton on your technology journey. Have a read of my articles, see what services I offer, and get in touch for a no-pressure no-obligation chat about what you need from your tech.
