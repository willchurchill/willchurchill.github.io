# About Will

I’m Will, and like most people I wear a lot of hats. One thing that I try to keep constant though is that I’m passionate about driving effective change, and enabling others to realise their potential.

I’ve worked in technology and tech transformation across a range of sectors, including charity foundations and social enterprises, healthcare, and in education. In addition, as co-founder of a web-agency, I’ve helped dozens of social organisations get the most out of their online presence. I’m currently the Technology Lead for [Esmee Fairbairn Foundation](https://esmeefairbairn.org.uk), and a trustee of [the School for Social Entrepreneurs](https://the-sse.org). 

With this site I want to share what I’ve learned - and what I’m still learning - about technology, the internet, and the huge role it plays in our lives. If you're in the social sector and want to understand more about how technology can make your work easier, I write this site for you. 

I also offer my services on a freelance basis, providing support for organisations on anything from web services to technology consultancy. You can see my specialties further down the page, or [drop me an email](mailto:will@willrc.co.uk) to arrange a chat about whether I can be of service to you.
