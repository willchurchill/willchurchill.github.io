## My experience with technology

<pullquote>First, solve the problem. Then, write the code. - John Johnson</pullquote>

With over a decade of career experience, Iâ€™ve both enjoyed and benefitted from a considered series of technology-focused roles across a range of sectors, with each allowing me to bring a fresh perspective to the next. My achievements include:

- Implementing technology transformation programmes across multiple hospitals, improving patient care and satisfaction, reducing hospital overheads, and improving staff morale.
- Developing a bespoke CRM tool for a networking organisation, using frontend and backend technologies, as well as integrating APIs to ensure compatibility with a wide range of systems.
- Developing and delivering over 100 training sessions for audiences such as industry professionals and high-school students, and subjects ranging from project management to cyber security.
- Supporting social businesses to help them understand how web technologies can expand their reach, and successfully improve their impact.

Throughout my career, my driving force has been unlocking human and organisational potential. I do this through measured, efficient, and expert use of technology. With a keen ability to both liaise with technical experts, and clearly relay information and concepts to non-technical colleagues, I am an invaluable member of any team.
