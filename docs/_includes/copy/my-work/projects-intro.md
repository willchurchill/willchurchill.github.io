# Projects I've worked on
In no particular order (well, actually in alphabetical order based on how I've named them), here are some of the projects I've worked on over the years. This isn't a full list, but hopefully gives you an idea as to the kinds of things I might be able to help you and your organisation with. I don't make any commission or get any rewards from any of the services or platforms that are mentioned below. If I recommend something, it's because I genuinely think its the right tool for the job - and that is the only reason.
