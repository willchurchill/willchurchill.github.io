# Working with me
I’ve worked for a range of organisations in a number of sectors, so I get that sometimes what you need is to be given a way of working, and sometimes what you need is a lot of flexibility. This outline aims to tick the first box, but please know that I’m always open to conversations about the best way to work with you.

## Working on discrete projects
If you’re looking at hiring me for project work, the first thing I usually suggest is a scoping call. This is to get an idea of what you need, as well as for me to understand the wider context of the work. 

From there, I’ll produce a “Scope of Work” document. This will include an outline of the work that I’ll do for you, how much it’ll cost, and a timeline estimate. Up to this point, there are no obligations - I don’t charge you for the initial call, or for producing the document. If you decide that I’m not the right fit for you, that’s fine!

If you do like what you read, then once you approve it I’ll get to work. You’ll be able to review everything before the end of the project. If there are things that need changing, that are still within the initial scope of work, you won’t pay for any extra time that takes. If you need to extend the project for whatever reason, we can adjust the initial scope, timeline, and cost, to make sure we capture everything.

## Buying ‘blocks’ of time
Sometimes it’s good to have someone that can pick up some of the technical slack for you. It might be you have a website that needs maintaining, or to run training on a system. For these cases, you can buy blocks of my time, and use those against a host of technology-based activities.

Once you’ve bought the time, I won’t use it without your approval, so you’re always in control. You’ll get regular updates on how much time you have left in the block, and can top-up as and when you need to.

## What else you should know
I work as a part-time freelancer, and I sometimes have more than one client at a time. I will always be upfront about this, and the timelines I give you will always take this into account. This is not always the right thing for you as a client, and if you present me a project that I think will be better provided to you by a larger outfit, I will tell you.

If we end up working together, any payments will be made to WRCTECH LTD. This is not a VAT registered company, and therefore I will not charge tax on any products or services.

If you have any questions about any of this document, please don’t hesitate to reach out!
