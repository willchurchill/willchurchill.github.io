## 4321 Extension
This was my first publicly available Chrome Extension, which I used for a while to help me manage overwhelm in specific projects. The idea is that you can chunk tasks into blocks of 4, 3, 2, then 1 final task. You can read more about how and why I created this in my [personal blog](https://willrc.co.uk/musings/my-new-todo-lists/).

If you want to use the extension, you can find it on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/4321-todo-extension/mmophiodbcfhifbdaklpfjdfiadgobpo).
