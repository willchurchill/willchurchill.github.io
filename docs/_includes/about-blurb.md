I’m Will, and like most people I wear a lot of hats. One thing that I try to keep constant though is that I’m passionate about driving effective change, and enabling others to realise their potential.

For over a decade I’ve worked in technology and tech transformation across a range of sectors, including charity foundations and social enterprises, healthcare, and in education. In addition, as co-founder of a web-agency, I’ve helped dozens of social organisations get the most out of their online presence. I’m currently the Technology Lead for [Esmee Fairbairn Foundation](https://esmeefairbairn.org.uk), and a trustee of [the School for Social Entrepreneurs](https://the-sse.org). 

With this site I want to share what I’ve learned - and what I’m still learning - about technology, the internet, and the huge role it plays in our lives. If you're in the social sector and want to understand more about how technology can make your work easier, I write this site for you. 

To learn more about me and my background, read my [about page]({{site.url}}/about). If you think there’s something missing from the site - [let me know]({{site.url}}/contact)! And if you think there is anything I might be able to help your organisation with, [drop me an email](mailto:will@willrc.co.uk) and we can arrange a no-obligation chat.

Otherwise, have a poke around, and I hope you find something useful.
