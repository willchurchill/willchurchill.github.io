When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, I started writing Technology Guides via Copy & Code - the web agency I co-founded with my wife [Ishita](htts://ishitaranjan.co.uk). I still try to put out content that I think people might find useful, completely free to access and use. These guides are based purely on my own research and understanding and are presented in the hope that others might benefit.
