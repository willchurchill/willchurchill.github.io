Whether through mentoring, programme delivery, or web development, I'm passionate about driving effective change, and enabling others to realise their potential.

I do this with a number of hats - as the co-founder and "Code" half of [Copy & Code](https://copyandcode.co.uk), as the Technology Lead at [Esmee Fairbairn Foundation](https://esmeefairbairn.org.uk), and as a Trustee for [School for Social Entrepreneurs](https://the-sse.org.uk).

This website is a place for me to opine, muse, and occasionally rant, about anything that's occupying my mind. I have particular interests in Politics, Technology, and Mental Health - so most of my stuff is about that. I don't pretend to be an expert in any of these things (expect, in some cases, technology - which I make most of my living from), and I certainly don't claim to speak for anyone but myself. I am, at the end of the day, just a guy with an opinion and an internet connection.

Feel free to have a poke about. You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/willchurchill) and, inexplicably, [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/willchurchill89/).
