# About Will

I’m Will, and like most people I wear a lot of hats. One thing that I try to keep constant though is that I’m passionate about driving effective change, and enabling others to realise their potential.

I’ve worked in technology and tech transformation across a range of sectors, including charity foundations and social enterprises, healthcare, and in education. In addition, as co-founder of a web-agency, I’ve helped dozens of social organisations get the most out of their online presence. I’m currently the Technology Lead for [Esmee Fairbairn Foundation](https://esmeefairbairn.org.uk), and a trustee of [the School for Social Entrepreneurs](https://the-sse.org). 

With this site I want to share what I’ve learned - and what I’m still learning - about technology, the internet, and the huge role it plays in our lives. If you're in the social sector and want to understand more about how technology can make your work easier, I write this site for you. 

I also offer my services on a freelance basis, providing support for organisations on anything from web services to technology consultancy. You can see my specialties further down the page, or [drop me an email](mailto:will@willrc.co.uk) to arrange a chat about whether I can be of service to you.

## My experience with technology

<pullquote>First, solve the problem. Then, write the code. - John Johnson</pullquote>

With over a decade of career experience, I’ve both enjoyed and benefitted from a considered series of technology-focused roles across a range of sectors, with each allowing me to bring a fresh perspective to the next. My achievements include:

- Implementing technology transformation programmes across multiple hospitals, improving patient care and satisfaction, reducing hospital overheads, and improving staff morale.
- Developing a bespoke CRM tool for a networking organisation, using frontend and backend technologies, as well as integrating APIs to ensure compatibility with a wide range of systems.
- Developing and delivering over 100 training sessions for audiences such as industry professionals and high-school students, and subjects ranging from project management to cyber security.
- Supporting social businesses to help them understand how web technologies can expand their reach, and successfully improve their impact.

Throughout my career, my driving force has been unlocking human and organisational potential. I do this through measured, efficient, and expert use of technology. With a keen ability to both liaise with technical experts, and clearly relay information and concepts to non-technical colleagues, I am an invaluable member of any team.
