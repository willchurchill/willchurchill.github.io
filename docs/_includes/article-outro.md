I believe there should be as few barriers to understanding technology as possible, so everything I post on this site is completely free to access. If you feel like you've learned something from this article, it would mean a lot if you shared it with others - via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://willrc.co.uk{{page.url|url_encode}}&text=Check+this+out+from+&#64;willchurchill&hashtags=technology,webdev), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://willrc.co.uk{{page.url|url_encode}}), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://willrc.co.uk{{page.url|url_encode}}&source=Will-Churchill), or any other way you see fit.

You can also, if you're so inclined, [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/willchurchill) (though please don't feel obliged to do so - there are definitely [better ways](https://actions.tommys.org/a/tommys-change) you can spend your money).

I also offer paid services and advice. If you think you or your organisation would benefit from this [drop me an email](mailto:will@willrc.co.uk) and we can arrange a no-pressure, no obligation, chat to see if I can help.
