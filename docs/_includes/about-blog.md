While the rest of the site is dedicated to technology and helping small social organisations, this part of the site is a place for me to opine, muse, and occasionally rant, about anything that's occupying my mind. I have particular interests in Politics, Technology, and Mental Health - so most of my stuff is about that. I don't pretend to be an expert in any of these things (expect, in some cases, technology - which I make most of my living from), and I certainly don't claim to speak for anyone but myself. I am, at the end of the day, just a guy with an opinion and an internet connection.

Feel free to have a poke about. You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/willranjhill) and, inexplicably, [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/willranjhill/).
