# Copy & Code

If you're reading this, chances are you've been sent here from the Copy & Code website.

Copy & Code was a business I set up with my now-wife [Ishita](https://ishitaranjan.co.uk), helping charities, social enterprises, and small businesses build websites, measure impact, and share their stories online.

We started C&C in 2017, but in-early 2022, we made the decision to start winding down the business. There were a number of reasons for this, but one of them was that as we'd learned and developed with the business we realised that our skills could be better put to use in other ways.

I still work with clients as an independant consultant on technology strategy, including web development work. If you're interested in learning more, you can reach out to me via email - [will@willrc.co.uk](mailto:will@willrc.co.uk).

If you're interested to see what Ishita is up to you should check out [Spark & Co.](https://sparkandco.co.uk), and if you're part of an organisation that wants to do better at working with marginsalised communities, reach out.
