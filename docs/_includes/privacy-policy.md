## Use of cookies on this site
This website uses Google Analytics to collect information statistics on viewers to this site. This data includes:

* Geographic Location (inexact - usually to the nearest large city)
* Device information - including type (e.g. Desktop vs Tablet vs Mobile), browser, and network carrier
* Time spent on the website - including time spent on individual pages
* How users move through the site - including what links are clicked on, and where you accessed the site from

Practically, this is useful to understand what content is more popular, where traffic comes from (and so where it makes sense to promote new content), and what the broad make-up of readers is (and whether articles can be tailored to better suit the audience). Google Analytics **does not** make Personal Identifiable Information, such as IP addresses, accessable to end users, and so there is no practical way for site administrators to know which individuals are accessing this site with the information collected.

* **cookie-notice** loads once you accept/decline the use of third party cookies on the website banner. If you accept, the value of this cookie is set to "accepted" and the website will load Google Analytics tracking cookie. If you decline, the value of this cookie is set to "declined" and the site will not load the Third Party cookies. This cookie is stored for 30 days (or until manually removed), after which you must approve/decline the use of Third Party cookies again.
